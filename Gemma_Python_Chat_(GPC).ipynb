This is important.\\n\\nThe part I didn\\'t get is that in the example construction\\n\\ngroups = []\\nuniquekeys = []\\nfor k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):\\n   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list\\n   uniquekeys.append(k)\\n\\n\\nk is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of that, using clearer variable names:\\n\\nfrom itertools import groupby\\n\\nthings = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    for thing in group:\\n        print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key)\\n    print \" \"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  A bear is a animal.\\n  A duck is a animal.\\n  \\n  A cactus is a plant.\\n  \\n  A speed boat is a vehicle.\\n  A school bus is a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nIn this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. \\n\\nThe groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. \\n\\nHere, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.\\n\\nIn the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.\\n\\nHere\\'s a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group])\\n    print key + \"s:  \" + listOfThings + \".\"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  animals: bear and duck.\\n  plants: cactus.\\n  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.\\n\\n'}\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n1. {'Question': \"Why is ''>0 True in Python?\", 'Answer': 'The original design motivation for allowing order-comparisons of arbitrary objects was to allow sorting of heterogenous lists -- usefully, that would put all strings next to each other in alphabetical order, and all numbers next to each other in numerical order, although which of the two blocks came first was not guaranteed by the language.  For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n'}\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n2. {'Question': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?', 'Answer': '&gt;&gt;&gt;

For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n',\n  'timestamp': 1712377529},\n {'reply_id': 'd8ae3827-ce4f-48a4-894f-bed5656ad840',\n  'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?',\n  'timestamp': 1712377529},\n {'reply_id': 'cdc551bf-527b-4694-9bf7-0de689a36d49',\n  'role': 'assitant',\n  'content': '&gt;&gt;&gt;

This is important.\n\nThe part I didn't get is that in the example construction\n\ngroups = []\nuniquekeys = []\nfor k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):\n   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list\n   uniquekeys.append(k)\n\n\nk is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.\n\nHere's an example of that, using clearer variable names:\n\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\nthings = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\n\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\n    for thing in group:\n        print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key)\n    print \" \"\n\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n\n  A bear is a animal.\n  A duck is a animal.\n  \n  A cactus is a plant.\n  \n  A speed boat is a vehicle.\n  A school bus is a vehicle.\n\n\nIn this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. \n\nThe groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. \n\nHere, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.\n\nIn the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.\n\nHere's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:\n\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\n    listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group])\n    print key + \"s:  \" + listOfThings + \".\"\n\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n\n  animals: bear and duck.\n  plants: cactus.\n  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.\n\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: Why is ''>0 True in Python?\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: The original design motivation for allowing order-comparisons of arbitrary objects was to allow sorting of heterogenous lists -- usefully, that would put all strings next to each other in alphabetical order, and all numbers next to each other in numerical order, although which of the two blocks came first was not guaranteed by the language.  For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\n\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn't really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn't do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\n\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\n\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that's both practical and pure;-).\n\nSo, it's only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\n\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: How to check what OS am I running on in Python?\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: &gt;&gt;&gt; import os\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print os.name\nposix\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import platform\n&gt;&gt;&gt; platform.system()\n'Linux'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; platform.release()\n'2.6.22-15-generic'\n\n\nSee: <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/platform.html\">platform √¢¬Ä¬î Access to underlying platform√¢¬Ä¬ôs identifying data\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: Create an encrypted ZIP file in Python\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: I created a simple library to create a password encrypted zip file in python. - <a href=\"https://github.com/smihica/pyminizip\">here\n\nimport pyminizip\n\ncompression_level = 5 # 1-9\npyminizip.compress(\"src.txt\", \"dst.zip\", \"password\", compression_level)\n\n\nThe library requires zlib.\n\nI have checked that the file can be extracted in WINDOWS/MAC.\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: Recursively walking a Python inheritance tree at run-time\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: You might try using the type.mro() method to find the method resolution order.\n\nclass A(object):\n        pass\n\nclass B(A):\n        pass\n\nclass C(A):\n        pass\n\na = A()\nb = B()\nc = C()\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type.mro(type(b))\n[&lt;class '__main__.B'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;, &lt;type 'object'&gt;]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type.mro(type(c))\n[&lt;class '__main__.C'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;, &lt;type 'object'&gt;]\n\n\nor\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type(b).mro()\n\n\n\n\nEdit:  I was thinking you wanted to do something like this...\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A = type(\"A\", (object,), {'a':'A var'})  # create class A\n&gt;&gt;&gt; B = type(\"B\", (A,), {'b':'B var'})       # create class B\n&gt;&gt;&gt; myvar = B()\n\ndef getvars(obj):\n    ''' return dict where key/value is attribute-name/class-name '''\n    retval = dict()\n    for i in type(obj).mro():\n        for k in i.__dict__:\n            if not k.startswith('_'):\n                retval[k] = i.__name__\n    return retval\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; getvars(myvar)\n{'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in getvars(myvar):\n    print getattr(myvar, i)   # or use setattr to modify the attribute value\n\nA Var\nB Var\n\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: How can I retrieve the page title of a webpage using Python?\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: Here's a simplified version of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/51242/4279\">@Vinko Vrsalovic's answer:\n\nimport urllib2\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(urllib2.urlopen(\"https://www.google.com\"))\nprint soup.title.string\n\n\nNOTE:\n\n\nsoup.title finds the first title element anywhere in the html document\ntitle.string assumes it has only one child node, and that child node is a string\n\n\nFor <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/\">beautifulsoup 4.x, use different import:\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: In Python, how can you easily retrieve sorted items from a dictionary?\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: Or shorter,\n\nfor key, value in sorted(d.items()):\n    print value\n\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: Python Inverse of a Matrix\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: You should have a look at <a href=\"http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial\">numpy if you do matrix manipulation.

You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.\\n\\nHere\\'s a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group])\\n    print key + \"s:  \" + listOfThings + \".\"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  animals: bear and duck.\\n  plants: cactus.\\n  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.\\n\\n',\n  'timestamp': 1712377529},\n {'reply_id': '7fcfecf1-7d7e-48bb-abc2-d01831477182',\n  'role': 'user',\n  'content': \"Why is ''>0 True in Python?\",\n  'timestamp': 1712377529},\n {'reply_id': '74dc1b00-4d0b-4984-a5e0-6f86b0ec3583',\n  'role': 'assitant',\n  'content': 'The original design motivation for allowing order-comparisons of arbitrary objects was to allow sorting of heterogenous lists -- usefully, that would put all strings next to each other in alphabetical order, and all numbers next to each other in numerical order, although which of the two blocks came first was not guaranteed by the language.  For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n',\n  'timestamp': 1712377529},\n {'reply_id': 'd8ae3827-ce4f-48a4-894f-bed5656ad840',\n  'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?',\n  'timestamp': 1712377529},\n {'reply_id': 'cdc551bf-527b-4694-9bf7-0de689a36d49',\n  'role': 'assitant',\n  'content': '&gt;&gt;&gt;
