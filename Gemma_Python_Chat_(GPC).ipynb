If you're wanting to use ctypes, you can use ATSFontGetFileReference after looking up the ATSFontRef.\\r\\n\\r\\nCocoa doesn't have any native support, at least as of 10.5, for getting the location of a font.\",\n \"Question:\\nGet a preview JPEG of a PDF on Windows?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nImageMagick delegates the PDF->bitmap conversion to GhostScript anyway, so here's a command you can use (it's based on the actual command listed by the ps:alpha delegate in ImageMagick, just adjusted to use JPEG as output):\\n\\ngs -q -dQUIET -dPARANOIDSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dNOPROMPT \\\\\\n-dMaxBitmap=500000000 -dLastPage=1 -dAlignToPixels=0 -dGridFitTT=0 \\\\\\n-sDEVICE=jpeg -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -r72x72 \\\\\\n-sOutputFile=$OUTPUT -f$INPUT\\n\\n\\nwhere $OUTPUT and $INPUT are the output and input filenames. Adjust the 72x72 to whatever resolution you need. (Obviously, strip out the backslashes if you're writing out the whole command as one line.)\\n\\nThis is good for two reasons:\\n\\n\\nYou don't need to have ImageMagick installed anymore. Not that I have anything against ImageMagick (I love it to bits), but I believe in simple solutions.\\nImageMagick does a two-step conversion. First PDF->PPM, then PPM->JPEG. This way, the conversion is one-step.\\n\\n\\nOther things to consider: with the files I've tested, PNG compresses better than JPEG. If you want to use PNG, change the -sDEVICE=jpeg to -sDEVICE=png16m.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nContinuous Integration System for a Python Codebase\\n\\nAnswer:\\nOne possibility is Hudson.

Even if the sequence is not large, building the list means iterating over the whole of the sequence before in could start its search.\\n\\nThe temporary list can be avoiding by using a generator expression:\\n\\nfoo = 12\\nfoo in (obj.id for obj in bar)\\n\\n\\nNow, as long as obj.id == 12 near the start of bar, the search will be fast, even if bar is infinitely long.\\n\\nAs @Matt suggested, it's a good idea to use hasattr if any of the objects in bar can be missing an id attribute:\\n\\nfoo = 12\\nfoo in (obj.id for obj in bar if hasattr(obj, 'id'))\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nClass views in Django\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI\\'ve created and used my own generic view classes, defining __call__ so an instance of the class is callable.  I really like it; while Django\\'s generic views allow some customization through keyword arguments, OO generic views (if their behavior is split into a number of separate methods) can have much more fine-grained customization via subclassing, which lets me repeat myself a lot less.  (I get tired of rewriting the same create/update view logic anytime I need to tweak something Django\\'s generic views don\\'t quite allow).\\n\\nI\\'ve posted some code at <a href=\"http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1009/\">djangosnippets.org.\\n\\nThe only real downside I see is the proliferation of internal method calls, which may impact performance somewhat.

After having used them extensively on a couple of projects, I feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly DRY to write, but very hard to read and maintain later, because functionality is spread across so many different places, and subclasses are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclasses and mixins. I now feel that <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/template-response/\">TemplateResponse and view decorators is a better answer for decomposing view code.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython and MySQL\\n\\nAnswer:\\nMySQLdb is what I have used before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you host is using Python version 2.5 or higher, support for sqlite3 databases is built in (sqlite allows you to have a relational database that is simply a file in your filesystem).  But buyer beware, sqlite is not suited for production, so it may depend what you are trying to do with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother option may be to call your host and complain, or change hosts.  Honestly these days, any self respecting web host that supports python and mysql ought to have MySQLdb pre installed.',\n 'Question:\\nHow do I use Python\\'s itertools.groupby()?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nAs Sebastjan said, you first have to sort your data. This is important.\\n\\nThe part I didn\\'t get is that in the example construction\\n\\ngroups = []\\nuniquekeys = []\\nfor k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):\\n   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list\\n   uniquekeys.append(k)\\n\\n\\nk is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of that, using clearer variable names:\\n\\nfrom itertools import groupby\\n\\nthings = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    for thing in group:\\n        print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key)\\n    print \" \"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  A bear is a animal.\\n  A duck is a animal.\\n  \\n  A cactus is a plant.\\n  \\n  A speed boat is a vehicle.\\n  A school bus is a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nIn this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. \\n\\nThe groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. \\n\\nHere, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.\\n\\nIn the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key.

Tuples can be thought of as being similar to Pascal records or C structs; they\\'re small collections of related data which may be of different types which are operated on as a group. For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally by convention you wouldn\\'t choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.  You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.',\n 'Question:\\nFile size differences after copying a file to a server v√É\\xada FTP\\n\\nAnswer:\\nDo you need to open the locfile in binary using rb?\\n\\nf = open (locfile, \"rb\")\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow can I create a directly-executable cross-platform GUI app using Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFirst you will need some GUI library with Python bindings and then (if you want) some program that will convert your python scripts into standalone executables.\\n\\nCross-platform GUI libraries with Python bindings (Windows, Linux, Mac)\\n\\nOf course, there are many, but the most popular that I\\'ve seen in wild are:\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter\">Tkinter  - based on <a href=\"http://www.tcl.tk/\">Tk GUI toolkit (de-facto standard GUI library for python, free for commercial projects)\\n<a href=\"http://www.wxpython.org/\">WxPython - based on <a href=\"http://www.wxwidgets.org/\">WxWidgets (very popular, free for commercial projects)\\n<a href=\"http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/news\">PyQt - based on <a href=\"http://trolltech.com/products/qt/\">Qt (also very popular and more stable than WxWidgets but costly license for commercial projects)\\n\\n\\nComplete list is at <a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming\">http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming\\n\\nSingle executable (Windows)\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.py2exe.org/\">py2exe - Probably the most popular out there (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2933/an-executable-python-app/31859#31859\">PyInstaller is also gaining in popularity)\\n\\n\\nSingle executable (Linux)\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/Freeze\">Freeze - works the same way like py2exe but targets Linux platform\\n\\n\\nSingle executable (Mac)\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/py2app/\">py2app - again, works like py2exe but targets Mac OS\\n\\n',\n \"Question:\\nCalling a function of a module from a string with the function's name in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nAssuming module foo with method bar:\\n\\nimport foo\\nmethodToCall = getattr(foo, 'bar')\\nresult = methodToCall()\\n\\n\\nAs far as that goes, lines 2 and 3 can be compressed to:\\n\\nresult = getattr(foo, 'bar')()\\n\\n\\nif that makes more sense for your use case.

I used swig extensively, boost.python some and pyrex and cython a lot. I also used ctypes. This is my breakdown:\\n\\nDisclaimer: This is my personal experience. I am not involved with any of these projects. \\n\\nswig:\\ndoes not play well with c++. It should, but name mangling problems in the linking step was a major headache for me on linux &amp; Mac OS X. If you have C code and want it interfaced to python, it is a good solution. I wrapped the GTS for my needs and needed to write basically a C shared library which I could connect to. I would not recommend it.\\n\\nCtypes:\\nI wrote a libdc1394 (IEEE Camera library) wrapper using ctypes and it was a very straigtforward experience. You can find the code on <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/pydc1394\">https://launchpad.net/pydc1394. It is a lot of work to convert headers to python code, but then everything works reliably. This is a good way if you want to interface an external library. Ctypes is also in the stdlib of python, so everyone can use your code right away. This is also a good way to play around with a new lib in python quickly. I can recommend it to interface to external libs. \\n\\nBoost.Python: Very enjoyable. If you already have C++ code of your own that you want to use in python, go for this. It is very easy to translate c++ class structures into python class structures this way. I recommend it if you have c++ code that you need in python. \\n\\nPyrex/Cython: Use Cython, not Pyrex. Period. Cython is more advanced and more enjoyable to use. Nowadays, I do everything with cython that i used to do with SWIG or Ctypes. It is also the best way if you have python code that runs too slow. The process is absolutely fantastic: you convert your python modules into cython modules, build them and keep profiling and optimizing like it still was python (no change of tools needed). You can then apply as much (or as little) C code mixed with your python code. This is by far faster then having to rewrite whole parts of your application in C; you only rewrite the inner loop. \\n\\nTimings: ctypes has the highest call overhead (~700ns), followed by boost.python (322ns), then directly by swig (290ns). Cython has the lowest call overhead (124ns) and the best feedback where it spends time on (cProfile support!). The numbers are from my box calling a trivial function that returns an integer from an interactive shell; module import overhead is therefore not timed, only function call overhead is.

The __iter__ returns the iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops.  The next() method returns the next value and is implicitly called at each loop increment.  next() raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more value to return, which is implicitly captured by looping constructs to stop iterating.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple example of a counter:\\n\\nclass Counter:\\n    def __init__(self, low, high):\\n        self.current = low\\n        self.high = high\\n\\n    def __iter__(self):\\n        return self\\n\\n    def next(self): # Python 3: def __next__(self)\\n        if self.current &gt; self.high:\\n            raise StopIteration\\n        else:\\n            self.current += 1\\n            return self.current - 1\\n\\n\\nfor c in Counter(3, 8):\\n    print c\\n\\n\\nThis will print:\\n\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n\\n\\nThis is easier to write using a generator, as covered in a previous answer:\\n\\ndef counter(low, high):\\n    current = low\\n    while current &lt;= high:\\n        yield current\\n        current += 1\\n\\nfor c in counter(3, 8):\\n    print c\\n\\n\\nThe printed output will be the same.

For Python 2.7 and above, argparse replaces optparse. See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3217673/why-use-argparse-rather-than-optparse\">this answer for more information.\\n\\nAs other people pointed out, you are better off going with optparse over getopt.  getopt is pretty much a one-to-one mapping of the standard getopt(3) C library functions, and not very easy to use.\\n\\noptparse, while being a bit more verbose, is much better structured and simpler to extend later on.\\n\\nHere\\'s a typical line to add an option to your parser:\\n\\nparser.add_option(\\'-q\\', \\'--query\\',\\n            action=\"store\", dest=\"query\",\\n            help=\"query string\", default=\"spam\")\\n\\n\\nIt pretty much speaks for itself; at processing time, it will accept -q or --query as options, store the argument in an attribute called query and has a default value if you don\\'t specify it.  It is also self-documenting in that you declare the help argument (which will be used when run with -h/--help) right there with the option.\\n\\nUsually you parse your arguments with:\\n\\noptions, args = parser.parse_args()\\n\\n\\nThis will, by default, parse the standard arguments passed to the script (sys.argv[1:])\\n\\noptions.query will then be set to the value you passed to the script.\\n\\nYou create a parser simply by doing\\n\\nparser = optparse.OptionParser()\\n\\n\\nThese are all the basics you need.  Here\\'s a complete Python script that shows this:\\n\\nimport optparse\\n\\nparser = optparse.OptionParser()\\n\\nparser.add_option(\\'-q\\', \\'--query\\',\\n    action=\"store\", dest=\"query\",\\n    help=\"query string\", default=\"spam\")\\n\\noptions, args = parser.parse_args()\\n\\nprint \\'Query string:\\', options.query\\n\\n\\n5 lines of python that show you the basics.\\n\\nSave it in sample.py, and run it once with\\n\\npython sample.py\\n\\n\\nand once with\\n\\npython sample.py --query myquery\\n\\n\\nBeyond that, you will find that optparse is very easy to extend.\\nIn one of my projects, I created a Command class which allows you to nest subcommands in a command tree easily.  It uses optparse heavily to chain commands together.  It\\'s not something I can easily explain in a few lines, but feel free to <a href=\"https://thomas.apestaart.org/moap/trac/browser/trunk/moap/extern/command/command.py\">browse around in my repository for the main class, as well as <a href=\"https://thomas.apestaart.org/moap/trac/browser/trunk/moap/command/doap.py\">a class that uses it and the option parser\\n',\n \"Question:\\nFind broken symlinks with Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nA common Python saying is that it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.  While I'm not a fan of this statement in real life, it does apply in a lot of cases.  Usually you want to avoid code that chains two system calls on the same file, because you never know what will happen to the file in between your two calls in your code.\\n\\nA typical mistake is to write something like:\\n\\nif os.path.exists(path):\\n    os.unlink(path)\\n\\n\\nThe second call (os.unlink) may fail if something else deleted it after your if test, raise an Exception, and stop the rest of your function from executing.  (You might think this doesn't happen in real life, but we just fished another bug like that out of our codebase last week - and it was the kind of bug that left a few programmers scratching their head and claiming 'Heisenbug' for the last few months)\\n\\nSo, in your particular case, I would probably do:\\n\\ntry:\\n    os.stat(path)\\nexcept OSError, e:\\n    if e.errno == errno.ENOENT:\\n        print 'path %s does not exist or is a broken symlink' % path\\n    else:\\n        raise e\\n\\n\\nThe annoyance here is that stat returns the same error code for a symlink that just isn't there and a broken symlink.\\n\\nSo, I guess you have no choice than to break the atomicity, and do something like\\n\\nif not os.path.exists(os.readlink(path)):\\n    print 'path %s is a broken symlink' % path\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nSpecifying a mySQL ENUM in a Django model\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFrom the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.choices\" rel=\"nofollow\">Django documentation:\\n\\nMAYBECHOICE = (\\n    (\\'y\\', \\'Yes\\'),\\n    (\\'n\\', \\'No\\'),\\n    (\\'u\\', \\'Unknown\\'),\\n)\\n\\n\\nAnd you define a charfield in your model :\\n\\nmarried = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=MAYBECHOICE)\\n\\n\\nYou can do the same with integer fields if you don\\'t like to have letters\\nin your db.\\n\\nIn that case, rewrite your choices:\\n\\nMAYBECHOICE = (\\n    (0, \\'Yes\\'),\\n    (1, \\'No\\'),\\n    (2, \\'Unknown\\'),\\n)\\n\\n',\n \"Question:\\nWhy Java and Python garbage collection methods are different?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThere are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...\\n\\nAnother drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.\\n\\nAlso, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all! Reference counting would be a bit of a drawback there in terms of performance...\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nUnicode vs UTF-8 confusion in Python / Django?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\n  what is a \"Unicode string\" in Python? Does that mean UCS-2?\\n\\n\\nUnicode strings in Python are stored internally either as UCS-2 (fixed-length 16-bit representation, almost the same as UTF-16) or UCS-4/UTF-32 (fixed-length 32-bit representation). It\\'s a compile-time option; on Windows it\\'s always UTF-16 whilst many Linux distributions set UTF-32 (√¢\\x80\\x98wide mode√¢\\x80\\x99) for their versions of Python.\\n\\nYou are generally not supposed to care: you will see Unicode code-points as single elements in your strings and you won\\'t know whether they\\'re stored as two or four bytes. If you\\'re in a UTF-16 build and you need to handle characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane you\\'ll be Doing It Wrong, but that\\'s still very rare, and users who really need the extra characters should be compiling wide builds.\\n\\n\\n  plain wrong, or is it?\\n\\n\\nYes, it\\'s quite wrong. To be fair I think that tutorial is rather old; it probably pre-dates wide Unicode strings, if not Unicode 3.1 (the version that introduced characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane).\\n\\nThere is an additional source of confusion stemming from Windows\\'s habit of using the term √¢\\x80\\x9cUnicode√¢\\x80\\x9d to mean, specifically, the UTF-16LE encoding that NT uses internally.

One of the problems you may find is that Python objects - like lists and dicts - may have references to other python objects (in this case, what would your size be? The size containing the size of each object or not?). There are some pointers overhead and internal structures related to object types and garbage collection. Finally, some python objects have non-obvious behaviors. For instance, lists reserve space for more objects than they have, most of the time; dicts are even more complicated since they can operate in different ways (they have a different implementation for small number of keys and sometimes they over allocate entries).\\n\\nThere is a <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/recipes/544288/\">big chunk of code (and an <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/recipes/546530/\">updated big chunk of code) out there to try to best approximate the size of a python object in memory.

But they will always be approximations.\\n\\nYou may also want to check some <a href=\"http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2002-March/135223.html\">old description about PyObject (the internal C struct that represents virtually all python objects).\\n',\n 'Question:\\nAre Python threads buggy?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nPython threads are good for concurrent I/O programming. Threads are swapped out of the CPU as soon as they block waiting for input from file, network, etc. This allows other Python threads to use the CPU while others wait. This would allow you to write a multi-threaded web server or web crawler, for example.\\n\\nHowever, Python threads are serialized by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock\">GIL when they enter interpreter core. This means that if two threads are crunching numbers, only one can run at any given moment. It also means that you can\\'t take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor architectures.\\n\\nThere are solutions like running multiple Python interpreters concurrently, using a C based threading library. This is not for the faint of heart and the benefits might not be worth the trouble.

IronPython also gives us the advantage of being able to easily drop into C# if we need a performance boost.  (Though to be honest we have never needed to do that.  All of our performance problems to date have been because we chose dumb algorithms rather than because the language was slow.)

It\\'s relying on undocumented internal implementation details of the admin, is likely to break again in future versions of Django, and is no easier to implement than just finding another JS calendar widget and using that.\\n\\nThat said, here\\'s what you have to do if you\\'re determined to make this work:\\n\\n\\nDefine your own ModelForm subclass for your model (best to put it in forms.py in your app), and tell it to use the AdminDateWidget / AdminTimeWidget / AdminSplitDateTime (replace \\'mydate\\' etc with the proper field names from your model):\\n\\nfrom django import forms\\nfrom my_app.models import Product\\nfrom django.contrib.admin import widgets                                       \\n\\nclass ProductForm(forms.ModelForm):\\n    class Meta:\\n        model = Product\\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\\n        super(ProductForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        self.fields[\\'mydate\\'].widget = widgets.AdminDateWidget()\\n        self.fields[\\'mytime\\'].widget = widgets.AdminTimeWidget()\\n        self.fields[\\'mydatetime\\'].widget = widgets.AdminSplitDateTime()\\n\\nChange your URLconf to pass \\'form_class\\': ProductForm instead of \\'model\\': Product to the generic create_object view (that\\'ll mean \"from my_app.forms import ProductForm\" instead of \"from my_app.models import Product\", of course).\\nIn the head of your template, include {{ form.media }} to output the links to the Javascript files.\\nAnd the hacky part: the admin date/time widgets presume that the i18n JS stuff has been loaded, and also require core.js, but don\\'t provide either one automatically.  So in your template above {{ form.media }} you\\'ll need:\\n\\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/my_admin/jsi18n/\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/media/admin/js/core.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\\n\\n\\nYou may also wish to use the following admin CSS (thanks <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38601/using-django-time-date-widgets-in-custom-form/719583#719583\">Alex for mentioning this):\\n\\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/media/admin/css/forms.css\"/&gt;\\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/media/admin/css/base.css\"/&gt;\\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/media/admin/css/global.css\"/&gt;\\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/media/admin/css/widgets.css\"/&gt;\\n\\n\\n\\nThis implies that Django\\'s admin media (ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX) is at /media/admin/ - you can change that for your setup.  Ideally you\\'d use a context processor to pass this values to your template instead of hardcoding it, but that\\'s beyond the scope of this question.\\n\\nThis also requires that the URL /my_admin/jsi18n/ be manually wired up to the django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog view (or null_javascript_catalog if you aren\\'t using I18N).  You have to do this yourself instead of going through the admin application so it\\'s accessible regardless of whether you\\'re logged into the admin (thanks <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38601/using-django-time-date-widgets-in-custom-form/408230#408230\">Jeremy for pointing this out).

Starting with Python 3.2 it also provides a convenient context manager for use in a with statement.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile fileinput is great for throwaway scripts, I would be wary of using it in real code because admittedly it\\'s not very readable or familiar. In real (production) code it\\'s worthwhile to spend just a few more lines of code to make the process explicit and thus make the code readable.\\n\\nThere are two options:\\n\\n\\nThe file is not overly large, and you can just read it wholly to memory. Then close the file, reopen it in writing mode and write the modified contents back.\\nThe file is too large to be stored in memory; you can move it over to a temporary file and open that, reading it line by line, writing back into the original file.

This is because every time a request comes in, the server starts the CGI application in its own process.  This is bad for two reasons:  1)  Starting and stopping a process can take time and 2) you can\\'t cache anything in memory.  You can go with FastCGI, but I would argue that you\\'d be better off just writing a straight <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/\">WSGI app if you\\'re going to go that route (the way WSGI works really isn\\'t a whole heck of a lot different from CGI).\\n\\nOther than that, your choices are for the most part how much you want the framework to do.  You can go with an all singing, all dancing framework like Django or Pylons.  Or you can go with a mix-and-match approach (use something like CherryPy for the HTTP stuff, SQLAlchemy for the database stuff, paste for deployment, etc).  I should also point out that most frameworks will also let you switch different components out for others, so these two approaches aren\\'t necessarily mutually exclusive.\\n\\nPersonally, I dislike frameworks that do too much magic for me and prefer the mix-and-match technique, but I\\'ve been told that I\\'m also completely insane.  :)\\n\\nHow much web programming experience do you have?

However, it's also worth noting that you should use a list if you want to use any of the list methods.  For example, the following code won't work:\\n\\ndef gen():\\n    return (something for something in get_some_stuff())\\n\\nprint gen()[:2]     # generators don't support indexing or slicing\\nprint [5,6] + gen() # generators can't be added to lists\\n\\n\\nBasically, use a generator expression if all you're doing is iterating once.

All of the\\n  formats support including\\n  package-specific data, project-wide\\n  metadata, C extensions, and Python\\n  code.\\n  \\n  The primary benefits of Python Eggs\\n  are:\\n  \\n  \\n  They enable tools like the \"Easy Install\" Python package manager\\n  .egg files are a \"zero installation\" format for a Python\\n  package; no build or install step is\\n  required, just put them on PYTHONPATH\\n  or sys.path and use them (may require\\n  the runtime installed if C extensions\\n  or data files are used)\\n  They can include package metadata, such as the other eggs they depend on\\n  They allow \"namespace packages\" (packages that just contain other\\n  packages) to be split into separate\\n  distributions (e.g. zope., twisted.,\\n  peak.* packages can be distributed as\\n  separate eggs, unlike normal packages\\n  which must always be placed under the\\n  same parent directory. This allows\\n  what are now huge monolithic packages\\n  to be distributed as separate\\n  components.)\\n  They allow applications or libraries to specify the needed\\n  version of a library, so that you can\\n  e.g. require(\"Twisted-Internet>=2.0\")\\n  before doing an import\\n  twisted.internet.\\n  They\\'re a great format for distributing extensions or plugins to\\n  extensible applications and frameworks\\n  (such as Trac, which uses eggs for\\n  plugins as of 0.9b1), because the egg\\n  runtime provides simple APIs to locate\\n  eggs and find their advertised entry\\n  points (similar to Eclipse\\'s\\n  \"extension point\" concept).\\n  There are also other benefits that may come from having a standardized\\n  format, similar to the benefits of\\n  Java\\'s \"jar\" format.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nGlade or no glade: What is the best way to use PyGtk?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI would say that it depends: if you find that using Glade you can build the apps you want or need to make than that\\'s absolutely fine. If however you actually want to learn how GTK works or you have some non-standard UI requirements you will have to dig into GTK internals (which are not that complicated).\\n\\nPersonally I\\'m usually about 5 minutes into a rich client when I need some feature or customization that is simply impossible through a designer such as Glade or <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Stetic\">Stetic. Perhaps it\\'s just me. Nevertheless it is still useful for me to bootstrap window design using a graphical tool.\\n\\nMy recommendation: if making rich clients using GTK is going to be a significant part of your job/hobby then learn GTK as well since you will need to write that code someday.\\n\\nP.S.

I often find myself filtering/mapping lists, and being able to say [line.replace(\"spam\",\"eggs\") for line in open(\"somefile.txt\") if line.startswith(\"nee\")] is really nice.\\nFunctions are first class objects.  They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.  This makes it really easy to say things like people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age) and thus sort a bunch of people on their age without having to define a custom comparator class or something equally verbose.\\nEverything is an object.  Java has basic types which aren\\'t objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  Array.sort is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.\\nProperties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they\\'re never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.\\'\\nDefault and keyword arguments.  In Java if you want a constructor that can take up to 5 optional arguments, you must define 6 different versions of that constructor.  And there\\'s no way at all to say Student(name=\"Eli\", age=25)\\nFunctions can only return 1 thing.  In Python you have tuple assignment, so you can say spam, eggs = nee() but in Java you\\'d need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields.\\nBuilt-in syntax for lists and dictionaries.\\nOperator Overloading.\\nGenerally better designed libraries.  For example, to parse an XML document in Java, you say<br />\\nDocument doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(\"test.xml\");<br />\\nand in Python you say<br />\\ndoc = parse(\"test.xml\")\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I could go on and on with further examples, but Python is just overall a much more flexible and expressive language.  It\\'s also dynamically typed, which I really like, but which comes with some disadvantages.\\n\\nJava has much better performance than Python and has way better tool support.  Sometimes those things matter a lot and Java is the better language than Python for a task; I continue to use Java for some new projects despite liking Python a lot more.  But as a language I think Python is superior for most things I find myself needing to accomplish.\\n',\n \"Question:\\nOpen source alternative to MATLAB's fmincon function?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIs your problem convex?

To fulfill the db query, the db server goes through several steps:\\n\\n\\nparse the SQL\\nwork up a query plan, i. e. decide on which indices to use (if any), optimize etc.\\nif an index is used, search it for the pointers to the actual data, then go to the appropriate location in the data or\\nif no index is used, scan the whole table to determine which rows are needed\\nload the data from disk into a temporary location (hopefully, but not necessarily, memory)\\nperform the count() and avg() calculations\\n\\n\\nSo, creating an array in Python and getting the average basically skips all these steps save the last one. As disk I/O is among the most expensive operations a program has to perform, this is a major flaw in the test (see also the answers to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26021/how-is-data-compression-more-effective-than-indexing-for-search-performance\">this question I asked here before). Even if you read the data from disk in your other test, the process is completely different and it\\'s hard to tell how relevant the results are.\\n\\nTo obtain more information about where Postgres spends its time, I would suggest the following tests:\\n\\n\\nCompare the execution time of your query to a SELECT without the aggregating functions (i. e. cut step 5)\\nIf you find that the aggregation leads to a significant slowdown, try if Python does it faster, obtaining the raw data through the plain SELECT from the comparison.\\n\\n\\nTo speed up your query, reduce disk access first. I doubt very much that it\\'s the aggregation that takes the time.\\n\\nThere\\'s several ways to do that:\\n\\n\\nCache data (in memory!) for subsequent access, either via the db engine\\'s own capabilities or with tools like memcached\\nReduce the size of your stored data\\nOptimize the use of indices. Sometimes this can mean to skip index use altogether (after all, it\\'s disk access, too). For MySQL, I seem to remember that it\\'s recommended to skip indices if you assume that the query fetches more than 10% of all the data in the table.\\nIf your query makes good use of indices, I know that for MySQL databases it helps to put indices and data on separate physical disks. However, I don\\'t know whether that\\'s applicable for Postgres.\\nThere also might be more sophisticated problems such as swapping rows to disk if for some reason the result set can\\'t be completely processed in memory. But I would leave that kind of research until I run into serious performance problems that I can\\'t find another way to fix, as it requires knowledge about a lot of little under-the-hood details in your process.\\n\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nI just realized that you seem to have no use for indices for the above query and most likely aren\\'t using any, too, so my advice on indices probably wasn\\'t helpful. Sorry. Still, I\\'d say that the aggregation is not the problem but disk access is.

The concept of (old-style) class is unrelated to the concept of type: if x is an instance of an old-style class, then x.__class__ designates the class of x, but type(x) is always &lt;type \\'instance\\'&gt;. This reflects the fact that all old-style instances, independently of their class, are implemented with a single built-in type, called instance. \\n  \\n  New-style classes were introduced in Python 2.2 to unify the concepts of class and type. A new-style class is simply a user-defined type, no more, no less. If x is an instance of a new-style class, then type(x) is typically the same as x.__class__ (although this is not guaranteed √¢\\x80\\x93 a new-style class instance is permitted to override the value returned for x.__class__).\\n  \\n  The major motivation for introducing new-style classes is to provide a unified object model with a full meta-model. It also has a number of immediate benefits, like the ability to subclass most built-in types, or the introduction of \"descriptors\", which enable computed properties. \\n  \\n  For compatibility reasons, classes are still old-style by default. New-style classes are created by specifying another new-style class (i.e. a type) as a parent class, or the \"top-level type\" object if no other parent is needed. The behaviour of new-style classes differs from that of old-style classes in a number of important details in addition to what type returns. Some of these changes are fundamental to the new object model, like the way special methods are invoked. Others are \"fixes\" that could not be implemented before for compatibility concerns, like the method resolution order in case of multiple inheritance. \\n  \\n  Python 3 only has new-style classes.

I have presented it at 3 of the last 4 US PyCons, and we have several hundred users who subscribe to our email lists. Our website (<a href=\"http://dabodev.com\">http://dabodev.com) has not had any service interruptions; I don\\'t know why the first responder claimed to have trouble. Support is through our email lists, and we pride ourselves on helping people quickly and efficiently.

The fact that it is still a few days away from a 0.9 release is more of a reflection of the rather conservative version numbering of my partner, Paul McNett, than any instabilities in the framework. I know of Dabo apps that have been in production since 2006; I have used it for my own projects since 2004.

That assumes, however, that you want cross-platform IPC on the same machine.  If you want to be able to talk to processes on remote machines, you\\'ll want to look at using sockets instead.  Luckily, if you\\'re talking about TCP at least, sockets and pipes behave pretty much the same behavior.  While the APIs for setting them up and connecting them are different, they both just act like streams of data.\\n\\nThe difficult part, however, is not the communication channel, but the messages you pass over it.  You really want to look at something that will perform verification and parsing for you.  I recommend looking at Google\\'s <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html\">Protocol Buffers. You basically create a spec file that describes the object you want to pass between processes, and there is a compiler that generates code in a number of different languages for reading and writing objects that match the spec.

To build a dictionary from an arbitrary object, it's sufficient to use __dict__. Usually, you'll declare your methods at class level and your attributes at instance level, so __dict__ should be fine. For example:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object):\\n...   def __init__(self):\\n...     self.b = 1\\n...     self.c = 2\\n...   def do_nothing(self):\\n...     pass\\n...\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.__dict__\\n{'c': 2, 'b': 1}\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, depending on what you want to do, it might be nice to inherit from dict. Then your class is already a dictionary, and if you want you can override getattr and/or setattr to call through and set the dict. For example:\\n\\n class Foo(dict):\\n     def __init__(self):\\n         pass\\n     def __getattr__(self, attr):\\n         return self[attr]\\n\\n     # etc...\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nIs it pythonic for a function to return multiple values?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nAbsolutely (for the example you provided).\\n\\nTuples are first class citizens in Python\\n\\nThere is a builtin function <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html\">divmod() that does exactly that.\\n\\nq, r = divmod(x, y) # ((x - x%y)/y, x%y) Invariant: div*y + mod == x\\n\\n\\nThere are other examples: zip, enumerate, dict.items. \\n\\nfor i, e in enumerate([1, 3, 3]):\\n    print \"index=%d, element=%s\" % (i, e)\\n\\n# reverse keys and values in a dictionary\\nd = dict((v, k) for k, v in adict.items()) # or \\nd = dict(zip(adict.values(), adict.keys()))\\n\\n\\nBTW, parentheses are not necessary most of the time.\\nCitation from <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq.html\">Python Library Reference: \\n\\n\\n  Tuples are constructed by the comma\\n  operator (not within square brackets),\\n  with or without enclosing parentheses,\\n  but an empty tuple must have the\\n  enclosing parentheses, such as a, b, c\\n  or ().

Any performance benefits would be vastly outweighed by the time and effort required.\\n\\nFirst, have you actually profiled the code? I doubt that compiling regexes is a significant part of the application's run-time. Remember that they are only compiled the first time the module is imported in the current execution -- thereafter, the module and its attributes are cached in memory.\\n\\nIf you have a program that basically spawns once, compiles a bunch of regexes, and then exits, you could try re-engineering it to perform multiple tests in one invocation.

So if you\\'re creating a few tuples and accessing them many many times, it may actually be faster to use lists instead.\\n\\nOf course if you want to change an item, the list will definitely be faster since you\\'d need to create an entire new tuple to change one item of it (since tuples are immutable).\\n',\n 'Question:\\nStatic class variables in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nVariables declared inside the class definition, but not inside a method are class or static variables:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClass:\\n...     i = 3\\n...\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MyClass.i\\n3 \\n\\n\\nAs @<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68645/static-class-variables-in-python#answer-69067\">millerdev points out, this creates a class-level \"i\" variable, but this is distinct from any instance-level \"i\" variable, so you could have\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; m = MyClass()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; m.i = 4\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MyClass.i, m.i\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (3, 4)\\n\\n\\nThis is different from C++ and Java, but not so different from C#, where a static member can\\'t be accessed using a reference to an instance.\\n\\nSee <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects\">what the Python tutorial has to say on the subject of classes and class objects.\\n\\n@Steve Johnson has already answered regarding <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090214211613/http://pyref.infogami.com/staticmethod\">static methods, also documented under <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#staticmethod\">\"Built-in Functions\" in the Python Library Reference.\\n\\nclass C:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def f(arg1, arg2, ...): ...\\n\\n\\n@beidy recommends <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#classmethod\">classmethods over staticmethod, as the method then receives the class type as the first argument, but I\\'m still a little fuzzy on the advantages of this approach over staticmethod.

As you know, Python is compiled just-in-time to byte code (.pyc files) when a file is run each time the file changes. Therefore, after the first run of a Python file, the compilation step is skipped and the Python interpreter simply fetches the precompiled .pyc file. Because of this, one could argue that Python has a native advantage over PHP. However, optimizers and caching systems can be installed for PHP websites (my favorite is <a href=\"http://eaccelerator.net/\">eAccelerator) to much the same effect.\\n\\nIn general, enough tools exist such that one can pretty much do everything that the other can do. Of course, as others have mentioned, there\\'s more than just speed involved in the business case to switch languages. We have an app written in oCaml at my current employer, which turned out to be a mistake because the original author left the company and nobody else wants to touch it. Similarly, the PHP-web community is much larger than the Python-web community; Website hosting services are more likely to offer PHP support than Python support; etc.\\n\\nBut back to speed.

That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.\\n\\nIf this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment\\'s key would probably begin with the associated post\\'s key.\\n\\nWith Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like \"Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N.\" (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of \" AND comment_id > last_comment_id\".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.\\n\\nSomething to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.\\n\\nReading over this answer, I find it a little vague.

If you\\'re used to writing code that runs in a straight line, and only calls functions which return immediately with results, the idea of waiting for something to call you back might be confusing.  But there\\'s nothing magical, no \"voodoo\" about callbacks.  At the lowest level, the reactor is just sitting around and waiting for one of a small number of things to happen:\\n\\n\\nData arrives on a connection (it will call dataReceived on a Protocol)\\nTime has passed (it will call a function registered with callLater).\\nA connection has been accepted (it will call buildProtocol on a factory registered with a listenXXX or connectXXX function).\\nA connection has been dropped (it will call connectionLost on the appropriate Protocol)\\n\\n\\nEvery asynchronous program starts by hooking up a few of these events and then kicking off the reactor to wait for them to happen.  Of course, events that happen lead to more events that get hooked up or disconnected, and so your program goes on its merry way.  Beyond that, there\\'s nothing special about asynchronous program structure that are interesting or special; event handlers and callbacks are just objects, and your code is run in the usual way.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple \"event-driven engine\" that shows you just how simple this process is.\\n\\n# Engine\\nimport time\\nclass SimplestReactor(object):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.events = []\\n        self.stopped = False\\n\\n    def do(self, something):\\n        self.events.append(something)\\n\\n    def run(self):\\n        while not self.stopped:\\n            time.sleep(0.1)\\n            if self.events:\\n                thisTurn = self.events.pop(0)\\n                thisTurn()\\n\\n    def stop(self):\\n        self.stopped = True\\n\\nreactor = SimplestReactor()\\n\\n# Application    \\ndef thing1():\\n    print \\'Doing thing 1\\'\\n    reactor.do(thing2)\\n    reactor.do(thing3)\\n\\ndef thing2():\\n    print \\'Doing thing 2\\'\\n\\ndef thing3():\\n    print \\'Doing thing 3: and stopping\\'\\n    reactor.stop()\\n\\nreactor.do(thing1)\\nprint \\'Running\\'\\nreactor.run()\\nprint \\'Done!\\'\\n\\n\\nAt the core of libraries like Twisted, the function in the main loop is not sleep, but an operating system call like select() or poll(), as exposed by a module like <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-select.html\">the Python select module.  I say \"like\" select, because this is an API that varies a lot between platforms, and almost every GUI toolkit has its own version.  Twisted currently provides an abstract interface to 14 different variations on this theme.  The common thing that such an API provides is provide a way to say \"Here are a list of events that I\\'m waiting for.  Go to sleep until one of them happens, then wake up and tell me which one of them it was.\"\\n',\n 'Question:\\nUpload files in Google App Engine\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIn fact, this question is answered in the App Egnine documentation.

There are two intertwined reasons actually, both HCI:\\n  \\n  (a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than postfix √¢\\x80\\x94 prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x*a + x*b to the clumsiness of doing the same thing using a raw OO notation.\\n  \\n  (b) When I read code that says len(x) I know that it is asking for the length of something. This tells me two things: the result is an integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary, when I read x.len(), I have to already know that x is some kind of container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that has a standard len(). Witness the confusion we occasionally have when a class that is not implementing a mapping has a get() or keys() method, or something that isn√¢\\x80\\x99t a file has a write() method.\\n  \\n  Saying the same thing in another way, I see √¢\\x80\\x98len√¢\\x80\\x98 as a built-in operation.

Other platforms do not support this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this function having or not having a visible name in the file system.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, to persist a temporary file (on Windows), you can do the following:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import tempfile, shutil\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode=\\'w+t\\', delete=False)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f.write(\\'foo\\')\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; file_name = f.name\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f.close()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; shutil.copy(file_name, \\'bar.txt\\')\\n\\n\\nThe solution Hans Sjunnesson provided is also off, because copyfileobj only copies from file-like object to file-like object, not file name:\\n\\n\\n  shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])\\n  \\n  \\n    Copy the contents of the file-like object fsrc to the file-like object fdst. The integer length, if given, is the buffer size. In particular, a negative length value means to copy the data without looping over the source data in chunks; by default the data is read in chunks to avoid uncontrolled memory consumption.

They're often a source of trouble and with MySQL they're not going to bring you the performance advantage you're hoping for.  This road may be a lot of effort to follow--politically--because there's so much best practices hand waving and textbook verbiage in this space about the advantages of connection pooling.\\n\\nConnection pools are simply a bridge between the post-web era of stateless applications (e.g. HTTP protocol) and the pre-web era of stateful long-lived batch processing applications.  Since connections were very expensive in pre-web databases (since no one used to care too much about how long a connection took to establish), post-web applications devised this connection pool scheme so that every hit didn't incur this huge processing overhead on the RDBMS.\\n\\nSince MySQL is more of a web-era RDBMS, connections are extremely lightweight and fast.  I have written many high volume web applications that don't use a connection pool at all for MySQL.\\n\\nThis is a complication you may benefit from doing without, so long as there isn't a political obstacle to overcome.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nWhat is a metaclass in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nClasses as objects\\n\\nBefore understanding metaclasses, you need to master classes in Python. And Python has a very peculiar idea of what classes are, borrowed from the Smalltalk language.\\n\\nIn most languages, classes are just pieces of code that describe how to produce an object. That\\'s kinda true in Python too:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class ObjectCreator(object):\\n...       pass\\n... \\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_object = ObjectCreator()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_object)\\n&lt;__main__.ObjectCreator object at 0x8974f2c&gt;\\n\\n\\nBut classes are more than that in Python. Classes are objects too.\\n\\nYes, objects. \\n\\nAs soon as you use the keyword class, Python executes it and creates\\nan OBJECT. The instruction\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class ObjectCreator(object):\\n...       pass\\n... \\n\\n\\ncreates in memory an object with the name \"ObjectCreator\". \\n\\nThis object (the class) is itself capable of creating objects (the instances), \\nand this is why it\\'s a class. \\n\\nBut still, it\\'s an object, and therefore:\\n\\n\\nyou can assign it to a variable\\nyou can copy it\\nyou can add attributes to it\\nyou can pass it as a function parameter\\n\\n\\ne.g.:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ObjectCreator) # you can print a class because it\\'s an object\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.ObjectCreator\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def echo(o):\\n...       print(o)\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; echo(ObjectCreator) # you can pass a class as a parameter\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.ObjectCreator\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hasattr(ObjectCreator, \\'new_attribute\\'))\\nFalse\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ObjectCreator.new_attribute = \\'foo\\' # you can add attributes to a class\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hasattr(ObjectCreator, \\'new_attribute\\'))\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ObjectCreator.new_attribute)\\nfoo\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ObjectCreatorMirror = ObjectCreator # you can assign a class to a variable\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ObjectCreatorMirror.new_attribute)\\nfoo\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ObjectCreatorMirror())\\n&lt;__main__.ObjectCreator object at 0x8997b4c&gt;\\n\\n\\nCreating classes dynamically\\n\\nSince classes are objects, you can create them on the fly, like any object.\\n\\nFirst, you can create a class in a function using class:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def choose_class(name):\\n...     if name == \\'foo\\':\\n...         class Foo(object):\\n...             pass\\n...         return Foo # return the class, not an instance\\n...     else:\\n...         class Bar(object):\\n...             pass\\n...         return Bar\\n...     \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MyClass = choose_class(\\'foo\\') \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyClass) # the function returns a class, not an instance\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.Foo\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyClass()) # you can create an object from this class\\n&lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x89c6d4c&gt;\\n\\n\\nBut it\\'s not so dynamic, since you still have to write the whole class yourself.\\n\\nSince classes are objects, they must be generated by something.\\n\\nWhen you use the class keyword, Python creates this object automatically. But as\\nwith most things in Python, it gives you a way to do it manually.\\n\\nRemember the function type? The good old function that lets you know what \\ntype an object is:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(type(1))\\n&lt;type \\'int\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(type(\"1\"))\\n&lt;type \\'str\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(type(ObjectCreator))\\n&lt;type \\'type\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(type(ObjectCreator()))\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.ObjectCreator\\'&gt;\\n\\n\\nWell, <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#type\">type has a completely different ability, it can also create classes on the fly. type can take the description of a class as parameters, \\nand return a class.\\n\\n(I  know, it\\'s silly that the same function can have two completely different uses according to the parameters you pass to it. It\\'s an issue due to backwards \\ncompatibility in Python)\\n\\ntype works this way:\\n\\ntype(name of the class, \\n     tuple of the parent class (for inheritance, can be empty), \\n     dictionary containing attributes names and values)\\n\\n\\ne.g.:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyShinyClass(object):\\n...       pass\\n\\n\\ncan be created manually this way:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; MyShinyClass = type(\\'MyShinyClass\\', (), {}) # returns a class object\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyShinyClass)\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.MyShinyClass\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(MyShinyClass()) # create an instance with the class\\n&lt;__main__.MyShinyClass object at 0x8997cec&gt;\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll notice that we use \"MyShinyClass\" as the name of the class\\nand as the variable to hold the class reference. They can be different,\\nbut there is no reason to complicate things.\\n\\ntype accepts a dictionary to define the attributes of the class. So:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):\\n...       bar = True\\n\\n\\nCan be translated to:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo = type(\\'Foo\\', (), {\\'bar\\':True})\\n\\n\\nAnd used as a normal class:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(Foo)\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.Foo\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(Foo.bar)\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Foo()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f)\\n&lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x8a9b84c&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f.bar)\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nAnd of course, you can inherit from it, so:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   class FooChild(Foo):\\n...         pass\\n\\n\\nwould be:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; FooChild = type(\\'FooChild\\', (Foo,), {})\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(FooChild)\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.FooChild\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(FooChild.bar) # bar is inherited from Foo\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nEventually you\\'ll want to add methods to your class. Just define a function\\nwith the proper signature and assign it as an attribute.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def echo_bar(self):\\n...       print(self.bar)\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; FooChild = type(\\'FooChild\\', (Foo,), {\\'echo_bar\\': echo_bar})\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(Foo, \\'echo_bar\\')\\nFalse\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(FooChild, \\'echo_bar\\')\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_foo = FooChild()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_foo.echo_bar()\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nAnd you can add even more methods after you dynamically create the class, just like adding methods to a normally created class object.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def echo_bar_more(self):\\n...       print(\\'yet another method\\')\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; FooChild.echo_bar_more = echo_bar_more\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(FooChild, \\'echo_bar_more\\')\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nYou see where we are going: in Python, classes are objects, and you can create a class on the fly, dynamically.\\n\\nThis is what Python does when you use the keyword class, and it does so by using a metaclass.\\n\\nWhat are metaclasses (finally)\\n\\nMetaclasses are the \\'stuff\\' that creates classes.\\n\\nYou define classes in order to create objects, right?\\n\\nBut we learned that Python classes are objects.\\n\\nWell, metaclasses are what create these objects. They are the classes\\' classes,\\nyou can picture them this way:\\n\\nMyClass = MetaClass()\\nMyObject = MyClass()\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve seen that type lets you do something like this:\\n\\nMyClass = type(\\'MyClass\\', (), {})\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s because the function type is in fact a metaclass. type is the \\nmetaclass Python uses to create all classes behind the scenes.\\n\\nNow you wonder why the heck is it written in lowercase, and not Type?\\n\\nWell, I guess it\\'s a matter of consistency with str, the class that creates\\nstrings objects, and int the class that creates integer objects. type is\\njust the class that creates class objects.\\n\\nYou see that by checking the __class__ attribute. \\n\\nEverything, and I mean everything, is an object in Python. That includes ints, \\nstrings, functions and classes. All of them are objects. And all of them have\\nbeen created from a class:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; age = 35\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; age.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'int\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = \\'bob\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'str\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(): pass\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'function\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar(object): pass\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bar()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.__class__\\n&lt;class \\'__main__.Bar\\'&gt;\\n\\n\\nNow, what is the __class__ of any __class__ ?\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; age.__class__.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'type\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name.__class__.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'type\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__class__.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'type\\'&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.__class__.__class__\\n&lt;type \\'type\\'&gt;\\n\\n\\nSo, a metaclass is just the stuff that creates class objects.\\n\\nYou can call it a \\'class factory\\' if you wish.\\n\\ntype is the built-in metaclass Python uses, but of course, you can create your\\nown metaclass.\\n\\nThe <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__metaclass__#__metaclass__\">__metaclass__ attribute\\n\\nYou can add a __metaclass__ attribute when you write a class:\\n\\nclass Foo(object):\\n  __metaclass__ = something...\\n  [...]\\n\\n\\nIf you do so, Python will use the metaclass to create the class Foo.\\n\\nCareful, it\\'s tricky.\\n\\nYou write class Foo(object) first, but the class object Foo is not created\\nin memory yet.\\n\\nPython will look for __metaclass__ in the class definition. If it finds it,\\nit will use it to create the object class Foo. If it doesn\\'t, it will use\\ntype to create the class.\\n\\nRead that several times.\\n\\nWhen you do:\\n\\nclass Foo(Bar):\\n  pass\\n\\n\\nPython does the following:\\n\\nIs there a __metaclass__ attribute in Foo?\\n\\nIf yes, create in memory a class object (I said a class object, stay with me here), with the name Foo by using what is in __metaclass__.\\n\\nIf Python can\\'t find __metaclass__, it will look for a __metaclass__ at the MODULE level, and try to do the same (but only for classes that don\\'t inherit anything, basically old-style classes). \\n\\nThen if it can\\'t find any __metaclass__ at all, it will use the Bar\\'s (the first parent) own metaclass (which might be the default type) to create the class object.\\n\\nBe careful here that the __metaclass__ attribute will not be inherited, the metaclass of the parent (Bar.__class__) will be. If Bar used a __metaclass__ attribute that created Bar with type() (and not type.__new__()), the subclasses will not inherit that behavior.\\n\\nNow the big question is, what can you put in __metaclass__ ?\\n\\nThe answer is: something that can create a class.\\n\\nAnd what can create a class? type, or anything that subclasses or uses it.\\n\\nCustom metaclasses\\n\\nThe main purpose of a metaclass is to change the class automatically,\\nwhen it\\'s created.\\n\\nYou usually do this for APIs, where you want to create classes matching the\\ncurrent context.\\n\\nImagine a stupid example, where you decide that all classes in your module\\nshould have their attributes written in uppercase. There are several ways to \\ndo this, but one way is to set __metaclass__ at the module level.\\n\\nThis way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass, \\nand we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase.\\n\\nLuckily, __metaclass__ can actually be any callable, it doesn\\'t need to be a\\nformal class (I know, something with \\'class\\' in its name doesn\\'t need to be \\na class, go figure... but it\\'s helpful).\\n\\nSo we will start with a simple example, by using a function.\\n\\n# the metaclass will automatically get passed the same argument\\n# that you usually pass to `type`\\ndef upper_attr(future_class_name, future_class_parents, future_class_attr):\\n  \"\"\"\\n    Return a class object, with the list of its attribute turned \\n    into uppercase.\\n  \"\"\"\\n\\n  # pick up any attribute that doesn\\'t start with \\'__\\' and uppercase it\\n  uppercase_attr = {}\\n  for name, val in future_class_attr.items():\\n      if not name.startswith(\\'__\\'):\\n          uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\\n      else:\\n          uppercase_attr[name] = val\\n\\n  # let `type` do the class creation\\n  return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attr)\\n\\n__metaclass__ = upper_attr # this will affect all classes in the module\\n\\nclass Foo(): # global __metaclass__ won\\'t work with \"object\" though\\n  # but we can define __metaclass__ here instead to affect only this class\\n  # and this will work with \"object\" children\\n  bar = \\'bip\\'\\n\\nprint(hasattr(Foo, \\'bar\\'))\\n# Out: False\\nprint(hasattr(Foo, \\'BAR\\'))\\n# Out: True\\n\\nf = Foo()\\nprint(f.BAR)\\n# Out: \\'bip\\'\\n\\n\\nNow, let\\'s do exactly the same, but using a real class for a metaclass:\\n\\n# remember that `type` is actually a class like `str` and `int`\\n# so you can inherit from it\\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type): \\n    # __new__ is the method called before __init__\\n    # it\\'s the method that creates the object and returns it\\n    # while __init__ just initializes the object passed as parameter\\n    # you rarely use __new__, except when you want to control how the object\\n    # is created.\\n    # here the created object is the class, and we want to customize it\\n    # so we override __new__\\n    # you can do some stuff in __init__ too if you wish\\n    # some advanced use involves overriding __call__ as well, but we won\\'t\\n    # see this\\n    def __new__(upperattr_metaclass, future_class_name, \\n                future_class_parents, future_class_attr):\\n\\n        uppercase_attr = {}\\n        for name, val in future_class_attr.items():\\n            if not name.startswith(\\'__\\'):\\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\\n            else:\\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\\n\\n        return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attr)\\n\\n\\nBut this is not really OOP. We call type directly and we don\\'t override\\nor call the parent __new__.

There is\\nnothing special about it: __new__ always receives the class it\\'s defined in, as first parameter. Just like you have self for ordinary methods which receive the instance as first parameter, or the defining class for class methods.\\n\\nOf course, the names I used here are long for the sake of clarity, but like\\nfor self, all the arguments have conventional names. So a real production\\nmetaclass would look like this:\\n\\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type): \\n\\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):\\n\\n        uppercase_attr = {}\\n        for name, val in dct.items():\\n            if not name.startswith(\\'__\\'):\\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\\n            else:\\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\\n\\n        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attr)\\n\\n\\nWe can make it even cleaner by using super, which will ease inheritance (because yes, you can have metaclasses, inheriting from metaclasses, inheriting from type):\\n\\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type): \\n\\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):\\n\\n        uppercase_attr = {}\\n        for name, val in dct.items():\\n            if not name.startswith(\\'__\\'):\\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\\n            else:\\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\\n\\n        return super(UpperAttrMetaclass, cls).__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attr)\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it. There is really nothing more about metaclasses.\\n\\nThe reason behind the complexity of the code using metaclasses is not because\\nof metaclasses, it\\'s because you usually use metaclasses to do twisted stuff\\nrelying on introspection, manipulating inheritance, vars such as __dict__, etc.\\n\\nIndeed, metaclasses are especially useful to do black magic, and therefore\\ncomplicated stuff. But by themselves, they are simple:\\n\\n\\nintercept a class creation\\nmodify the class\\nreturn the modified class\\n\\n\\nWhy would you use metaclasses classes instead of functions?\\n\\nSince __metaclass__ can accept any callable, why would you use a class\\nsince it\\'s obviously more complicated?\\n\\nThere are several reasons to do so:\\n\\n\\nThe intention is clear. When you read UpperAttrMetaclass(type), you know\\nwhat\\'s going to follow\\nYou can use OOP. Metaclass can inherit from metaclass, override parent methods. Metaclasses can even use metaclasses.\\nYou can structure your code better. You never use metaclasses for something as\\ntrivial as the above example. It\\'s usually for something complicated. Having the\\nability to make several methods and group them in one class is very useful\\nto make the code easier to read.\\nYou can hook on __new__, __init__ and __call__. Which will allow\\nyou to do different stuff. Even if usually you can do it all in __new__, \\nsome people are just more comfortable using __init__.\\nThese are called metaclasses, damn it! It must mean something!\\n\\n\\nWhy would you use metaclasses?\\n\\nNow the big question. Why would you use some obscure error prone feature?\\n\\nWell, usually you don\\'t:\\n\\n\\n  Metaclasses are deeper magic that\\n  99% of users should never worry about.\\n  If you wonder whether you need them,\\n  you don\\'t (the people who actually\\n  need them know with certainty that\\n  they need them, and don\\'t need an\\n  explanation about why). \\n\\n\\nPython Guru Tim Peters\\n\\nThe main use case for a metaclass is creating an API. A typical example of this is the Django ORM.\\n\\nIt allows you to define something like this:\\n\\nclass Person(models.Model):\\n  name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\\n  age = models.IntegerField()\\n\\n\\nBut if you do this:\\n\\nguy = Person(name=\\'bob\\', age=\\'35\\')\\nprint(guy.age)\\n\\n\\nIt won\\'t return an IntegerField object. It will return an int, and can even take it directly from the database.\\n\\nThis is possible because models.Model defines __metaclass__ and \\nit uses some magic that will turn the Person you just defined with simple statements\\ninto a complex hook to a database field. \\n\\nDjango makes something complex look simple by exposing a simple API\\nand using metaclasses, recreating code from this API to do the real job\\nbehind the scenes.\\n\\nThe last word\\n\\nFirst, you know that classes are objects that can create instances.\\n\\nWell in fact, classes are themselves instances. Of metaclasses.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object): pass\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(Foo)\\n142630324\\n\\n\\nEverything is an object in Python, and they are all either instances of classes\\nor instances of metaclasses.\\n\\nExcept for type.\\n\\ntype is actually its own metaclass. This is not something you could\\nreproduce in pure Python, and is done by cheating a little bit at the implementation\\nlevel.\\n\\nSecondly, metaclasses are complicated. You may not want to use them for \\nvery simple class alterations. You can change classes by using two different techniques:\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch\">monkey patching\\nclass decorators\\n\\n\\n99% of the time you need class alteration, you are better off using these.\\n\\nBut 99% of the time, you don\\'t need class alteration at all.\\n',\n \"Question:\\nWhat is the standard way to add N seconds to datetime.time in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou can use full datetime variables with timedelta, and by providing a dummy date then using time to just get the time value.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nimport datetime\\na = datetime.datetime(100,1,1,11,34,59)\\nb = a + datetime.timedelta(0,3) # days, seconds, then other fields.\\nprint a.time()\\nprint b.time()\\n\\n\\nresults in the two values, three seconds apart:\\n\\n11:34:59\\n11:35:02\\n\\n\\nYou could also opt for the more readable\\n\\nb = a + datetime.timedelta(seconds=3)\\n\\n\\nif you're so inclined.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you're after a function that can do this, you can look into using addSecs below:\\n\\nimport datetime\\n\\ndef addSecs(tm, secs):\\n    fulldate = datetime.datetime(100, 1, 1, tm.hour, tm.minute, tm.second)\\n    fulldate = fulldate + datetime.timedelta(seconds=secs)\\n    return fulldate.time()\\n\\na = datetime.datetime.now().time()\\nb = addSecs(a, 300)\\nprint a\\nprint b\\n\\n\\nThis outputs:\\n\\n 09:11:55.775695\\n 09:16:55\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nHow can I analyze Python code to identify problematic areas?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFor measuring cyclomatic complexity, there\\'s a nice tool available at <a href=\"http://www.traceback.org/2008/03/31/measuring-cyclomatic-complexity-of-python-code/\">traceback.org.

Roughly, we are asking the object : are you meaningful or not ? This is done using the following algorithm :\\n\\n\\nIf the object has a __nonzero__ special method (as do numeric built-ins, int and float), it calls this method. It must either return a bool value which is then directly used, or an int value that is considered False if equal to zero.\\nOtherwise, if the object has a __len__ special method (as do container built-ins, list, dict, set, tuple, ...), it calls this method, considering a container False if it is empty (length is zero).\\nOtherwise, the object is considered True unless it is None in which case, it is considered False.\\n\\n\\nIn the second test, the object is compared for equality to None. Here, we are asking the object, \"Are you equal to this other value?\" This is done using the following algorithm :\\n\\n\\nIf the object has a __eq__ method, it is called, and the return value is then converted to a boolvalue and used to determine the outcome of the if.\\nOtherwise, if the object has a __cmp__ method, it is called. This function must return an int indicating the order of the two object (-1 if self &lt; other, 0 if self == other, +1 if self &gt; other).\\nOtherwise, the object are compared for identity (ie. they are reference to the same object, as can be tested by the is operator).\\n\\n\\nThere is another test possible using the is operator. We would be asking the object, \"Are you this particular object?\"\\n\\nGenerally, I would recommend to use the first test with non-numerical values, to use the test for equality when you want to compare objects of the same nature (two strings, two numbers, ...) and to check for identity only when using sentinel values (None meaning not initialized for a member field for exemple, or when using the getattr or the __getitem__ methods).\\n\\nTo summarize, we have :\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object):\\n...    def __repr__(self):\\n...        return \\'A()\\'\\n...    def __nonzero__(self):\\n...        return False\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(object):\\n...    def __repr__(self):\\n...        return \\'B()\\'\\n...    def __len__(self):\\n...        return 0\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):\\n...    def __repr__(self):\\n...        return \\'C()\\'\\n...    def __cmp__(self, other):\\n...        return 0\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class D(object):\\n...    def __repr__(self):\\n...        return \\'D()\\'\\n...    def __eq__(self, other):\\n...        return True\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for obj in [\\'\\', (), [], {}, 0, 0., A(), B(), C(), D(), None]:\\n...     print \\'%4s: bool(obj) -&gt; %5s, obj == None -&gt; %5s, obj is None -&gt; %5s\\' % \\\\\\n...

You use them by iterating over them, either explicitly with 'for' or implicitly by passing it to any function or construct that iterates. You can think of generators as returning multiple items, as if they return a list, but instead of returning them all at once they return them one-by-one, and the generator function is paused until the next item is requested.\\n\\nGenerators are good for calculating large sets of results (in particular calculations involving loops themselves) where you don't know if you are going to need all results, or where you don't want to allocate the memory for all results at the same time. Or for situations where the generator uses another generator, or consumes some other resource, and it's more convenient if that happened as late as possible.\\n\\nAnother use for generators (that is really the same) is to replace callbacks with iteration. In some situations you want a function to do a lot of work and occasionally report back to the caller. Traditionally you'd use a callback function for this. You pass this callback to the work-function and it would periodically call this callback. The generator approach is that the work-function (now a generator) knows nothing about the callback, and merely yields whenever it wants to report something. The caller, instead of writing a separate callback and passing that to the work-function, does all the reporting work in a little 'for' loop around the generator.\\n\\nFor example, say you wrote a 'filesystem search' program. You could perform the search in its entirety, collect the results and then display them one at a time. All of the results would have to be collected before you showed the first, and all of the results would be in memory at the same time. Or you could display the results while you find them, which would be more memory efficient and much friendlier towards the user. The latter could be done by passing the result-printing function to the filesystem-search function, or it could be done by just making the search function a generator and iterating over the result.\\n\\nIf you want to see an example of the latter two approaches, see os.path.walk() (the old filesystem-walking function with callback) and os.walk() (the new filesystem-walking generator.) Of course, if you really wanted to collect all results in a list, the generator approach is trivial to convert to the big-list approach:\\n\\nbig_list = list(the_generator)\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nHow do I merge a 2D array in Python into one string with List Comprehension?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nLike so:\\n\\n[ item for innerlist in outerlist for item in innerlist ]\\n\\n\\nTurning that directly into a string with separators:\\n\\n\\',\\'.join(str(item) for innerlist in outerlist for item in innerlist)\\n\\n\\nYes, the order of \\'for innerlist in outerlist\\' and \\'for item in innerlist\\' is correct.

And even then, only the variables themselves (the names that refer to objects) are local to the function; objects themselves are always global, and anything can refer to them.\\nThe Thread object for a particular thread is not a special object in this regard. If you store the Thread object somewhere all threads can access (like a global variable) then all threads can access that one Thread object. If you want to atomically modify anything that you didn\\'t just create in this very same thread, and did not store anywhere another thread can get at it, you have to protect it by a lock. And all threads must of course share this very same lock, or it wouldn\\'t be very effective.\\n\\nIf you want actual thread-local storage, that\\'s where threading.local comes in. Attributes of threading.local are not shared between threads; each thread sees only the attributes it itself placed in there. If you\\'re curious about its implementation, the source is in _threading_local.py in the standard library.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nAre locks unnecessary in multi-threaded Python code because of the GIL?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou will still need locks if you share state between threads. The GIL only protects the interpreter internally. You can still have inconsistent updates in your own code.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n#!/usr/bin/env python\\nimport threading\\n\\nshared_balance = 0\\n\\nclass Deposit(threading.Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        for _ in xrange(1000000):\\n            global shared_balance\\n            balance = shared_balance\\n            balance += 100\\n            shared_balance = balance\\n\\nclass Withdraw(threading.Thread):\\n    def run(self):\\n        for _ in xrange(1000000):\\n            global shared_balance\\n            balance = shared_balance\\n            balance -= 100\\n            shared_balance = balance\\n\\nthreads = [Deposit(), Withdraw()]\\n\\nfor thread in threads:\\n    thread.start()\\n\\nfor thread in threads:\\n    thread.join()\\n\\nprint shared_balance\\n\\n\\nHere, your code can be interrupted between reading the shared state (balance = shared_balance) and writing the changed result back (shared_balance = balance), causing a lost update. The result is a random value for the shared state.\\n\\nTo make the updates consistent, run methods would need to lock the shared state around the read-modify-write sections (inside the loops) or have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory\">some way to detect when the shared state had changed since it was read.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nMaking a beta code for a public django site\\n\\nAnswer:\\nStart with <a href=\"http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/136/\">this Django snippet, but modify it to check request.session[\\'has_beta_access\\'].

If you start trying to attack a testing problem by saying \"Let\\'s verify that it modifies its environment correctly\", you\\'re doomed to failure.  Environments have dozens, maybe even millions of potential variations.\\n\\nInstead, look at the pieces (\"units\") of your program.  For example, are you going to have a function that determines where the files are that have to be written?  What are the inputs to that function?  Perhaps an environment variable, perhaps some values read from a config file?  Test that function, and don\\'t actually do anything that modifies the filesystem.  Don\\'t pass it \"realistic\" values, pass it values that are easy to verify against.  Make a temporary directory, populate it with files in your test\\'s setUp method.\\n\\nThen test the code that writes the files.  Just make sure it\\'s writing the right contents file contents.  Don\\'t even write to a real filesystem!  You don\\'t need to make \"fake\" file objects for this, just use Python\\'s handy StringIO modules; they\\'re \"real\" implementations of the \"file\" interface, they\\'re just not the ones that your program is actually going to be writing to.\\n\\nUltimately you will have to test the final, everything-is-actually-hooked-up-for-real top-level function that passes the real environment variable and the real config file and puts everything together.  But don\\'t worry about that to get started.  For one thing, you will start picking up tricks as you write individual tests for smaller functions and creating test mocks, fakes, and stubs will become second nature to you.  For another: even if you can\\'t quite figure out how to test that one function call, you will have a very high level of confidence that everything which it is calling works perfectly.  Also, you\\'ll notice that test-driven development forces you to make your APIs clearer and more flexible.  For example: it\\'s much easier to test something that calls an open() method on an object that came from somewhere abstract, than to test something that calls os.open on a string that you pass it.  The open method is flexible; it can be faked, it can be implemented differently, but a string is a string and os.open doesn\\'t give you any leeway to catch what methods are called on it.\\n\\nYou can also build testing tools to make repetitive tasks easy.  For example, twisted provides facilities for creating temporary files for testing <a href=\"http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase.html#mktemp\">built right into its testing tool.  It\\'s not uncommon for testing tools or larger projects with their own test libraries to have functionality like this.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow do you send a HEAD HTTP request in Python 2?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">urllib2 can be used to perform a HEAD request.

As previous posters have indicated, you can append to a file or overwrite part of it using seek but if you want to add stuff at the beginning or the middle, you'll have to rewrite it.\\n\\nThis is an operating system thing, not a Python thing. It is the same in all languages.\\n\\nWhat I usually do is read from the file, make the modifications and write it out to a new file called myfile.txt.tmp or something like that. This is better than reading the whole file into memory because the file may be too large for that. Once the temporary file is completed, I rename it the same as the original file.\\n\\nThis is a good, safe way to do it because if the file write crashes or aborts for any reason, you still have your untouched original file.\\n\",\n \"Question:\\nPython library for rendering HTML and javascript\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe big complication here is emulating the full browser environment outside of a browser.

As we all know Python isn\\'t anywhere near C speed (with current compilers and interpreters) but worse than that is that what C is good at (bit-fiddling, integer math, tricks with blocks of memory) Python is very slow at, and what Python is good at you can\\'t express in C directly. A direct translation would therefore be extra inefficient, to the point of absurdity.\\n\\nThe much, much better approach in general is indeed to keep the C the C, and wrap it in a Python extension module (using <a href=\"http://www.swig.org\">SWIG, <a href=\"http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/\">Pyrex, <a href=\"http://cython.org\">Cython or <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/ext\">writing a wrapper manually) or call the C library directly using <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ctypes.html\">ctypes. All the benefits (and downsides) of C for what\\'s already C or you add later, and all the convenience (and downsides) of Python for any code in Python.\\n\\nThat won\\'t satisfy your \\'sandboxing\\' needs, but you should realize that you cannot sandbox Python particularly well anyway; it takes a lot of effort and modification of CPython, and if you forget one little hole somewhere your jail is broken.

You rarely need to pass around unnamed function objects.\\n\\nThe builtins map() and filter() need function objects, but list comprehensions and generator expressions are generally more readable than those functions and can cover all use cases, without the need of lambdas. \\n\\nFor the cases you really need a small function object, you should use the operator module functions, like operator.add instead of lambda x, y: x + y\\n\\nIf you still need some lambda not covered, you might consider writing a def, just to be more readable. If the function is more complex than the ones at operator module, a def is probably better. \\n\\nSo, real world good lambda use cases are very rare.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nDisplay number with leading zeros\\n\\nAnswer:\\nHere you are:\\n\\nprint \"%02d\" % (1,)\\n\\n\\nBasically % is like printf or sprint.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython Library Path\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI think you\\'re looking for <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path\">sys.path\\n\\nimport sys\\nprint (sys.path)\\n\\n',\n \"Question:\\nShould you always favor xrange() over range()?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFor performance, especially when you're iterating over a large range, xrange() is usually better.

If you want to write code that will run on both Python 2 and Python 3, you can't use xrange().\\nrange() can actually be faster in some cases - eg. if iterating over the same sequence multiple times.  xrange() has to reconstruct the integer object every time, but range() will have real integer objects.  (It will always perform worse in terms of memory however)\\nxrange() isn't usable in all cases where a real list is needed.

So range(1000000) will actually allocate a list big enough to hold 2^20 elements (~ 1.045 million).\\n\\nThis is only the space required to store the list structure itself (which is an array of pointers to the Python objects for each element).  A 32-bit system will require 4 bytes per element, a 64-bit system will use 8 bytes per element.\\n\\nFurthermore, you need space to store the actual elements.  This varies widely.  For small integers (-5 to 256 currently), no additional space is needed, but for larger numbers Python allocates a new object for each integer, which takes 10-100 bytes and tends to fragment memory.\\n\\nBottom line: it\\'s complicated and Python lists are not a good way to store large homogeneous data structures.  For that, use the array module or, if you need to do vectorized math, use NumPy.\\n\\nPS- Tuples, unlike lists, are not designed to have elements progressively appended to them.  I don\\'t know how the allocator works, but don\\'t even think about using it for large data structures :-)\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython: SWIG vs ctypes\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI have a rich experience of using swig.

Generally it leads to drawbacks:\\n- needs configuration (SWIG .i templates), sometimes it is tricky,\\n- lack of treatment of some special cases (see python properties further),\\n- lack of the performance for some languages.  \\n\\nPython cons:  \\n\\n1) Code style inconsistancy. C++ and python have very different code styles (that is obvious, certainly), the possibilities of swig of making target code more pythonish is very limited. As example,  it is butt-heart to create properties from getters and setters. See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1183716/python-properties-swig\">this q&amp;a\\n\\n2) Lack of broad community. Swig have some good documentation. But if one caught something that is not in the documentation, there is no information at all. No blogs nor googling helps. So one have to heavily dig SWIG generated code in such cases... That is terrible, I could say... \\n\\nProcs:\\n\\n\\nIn simple cases it is really rapid, easy and straight forward\\nIf you produced swig interface files once, you can wrap this C++ code to ANY of other 20+ languages (!!!). \\nOne big concern about SWIG is a performance.

At least <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/456884/extending-python-to-swig-not-to-swig-or-cython\">some benchmarks shows this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen to USE SWIG?\\n\\nSo I concluded for myself two cases when the swig is good to use:\\n\\n2) If one needs to wrap C++ code for several languages. Or if potentially there could be a time when one needs to distribute the code for several languages. Using SWIG is reliable in this case. \\n\\n1) If one needs to rapidly wrap just several functions from some C++ library for end use.\\n\\n\\n\\nLive experience\\n\\nUpdate :\\nIt is a year and half passed as we did a conversion of our library by using SWIG.\\n\\nFirst we made a python version.There were several moments when we experienced troubles with SWIG - it is true. But right now we expanded our library to Java and .NET. So we have 3 languages with 1 SWIG. And I could say that SWIG rocks in terms of saving a LOT of time. \\n\\nUpdate 2:\\nIt is two years as we use SWIG for this library. SWIG is integrated in our build system. Recently we had major API change of C++ library. SWIG worked perfectly. The only thing we needed to do is to add several %rename to .i files so our CppCamelStyleFunctions() now looks_more_pythonish in python. First I was concerned about some problems that could arise, but nothing went wrong. It was amazing. Just several edits and everything distributed in 3 languages. Now I am confident that it was a good solution to use SWIG in our case. \\n\\nUpdate 3:\\nIt is 3+ years we use SWIG for our library. Major change: python part was totally rewritten in pure python. The reason is that python is used for the majority of applications of our library now. Even if pure python version works slower than C++ wrapping, it is more convenient for users to work with pure python, not struggling with native libraries. \\n\\nSWIG is still used for .NET and Java versions.\\n\\nThe Main question here \"Would we use SWIG for python, if we started the project from the beginning?\". We would! SWIG allowed us to rapidly distribute our product to many languages.

This way, it runs the test against whatever our current local database looks like.  But be very careful if you use this method because any changes to data you make in your tests will be permanent.  I made sure that all our tests restores any changes back to their original state, and keep our pristine version of our database on the server and backed up.\\n\\nSo to do this you need to copy the run_test method from django.test.simple to a location in your project -- I put mine in myproject/test/test_runner.py\\n\\nThen make the following changes to that method:\\n\\n// change\\nold_name = settings.DATABASE_NAME\\nfrom django.db import connection\\nconnection.creation.create_test_db(verbosity, autoclobber=not interactive)\\nresult = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=verbosity).run(suite)\\nconnection.creation.destroy_test_db(old_name, verbosity)\\n\\n// to:\\nresult = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=verbosity).run(suite)\\n\\n\\nMake sure to do all the necessary imports at the top and then in your settings file set the setting:\\n\\nTEST_RUNNER = \\'myproject.test.test_runner.run_tests\\'\\n\\n\\nNow when you run ./manage.py test Django will run the tests against the current state of your database rather than creating a new version based on your current model definitions.\\n\\nAnother thing you can do is create a copy of your database locally, and then do a check in your new run_test() method like this:\\n\\nif settings.DATABASE_NAME != \\'my_test_db\\': \\n    sys.exit(\"You cannot run tests using the %s database.

The problem with isinstance(x, basestring) is that there is no way for the caller to tell you, for instance, that even though the type is not a basestring, you should treat it as a string (and not another sequence.) And perhaps the caller would like to use the same type for different purposes, sometimes as a single item, and sometimes as a sequence of items.

This is because your main settings.py probably has a line like:\\n\\nROOT_URLCONF = `myproject.urls`\\n\\n\\nTo solve this, try using the full import in your shell session:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from myproject.myapp import views\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse(views.myview)\\n'/myview/'\\n\\n\\nHere's a log of the debugging session, for any interested future readers:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.core import urlresolvers\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from myapp import myview\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; urlresolvers.get_resolver (None).reverse_dict\\n{None: ([(u'myview/', [])], 'myview/$'), &lt;function myview at 0x845d17c&gt;: ([(u'myview/', [])], 'myview/$')}\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v1 = urlresolvers.get_resolver (None).reverse_dict.items ()[1][0]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse(v1)\\n'/myview/'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v1 is myview\\nFalse\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; v1.__module__\\n'testproject.myapp.views'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; myview.__module__\\n'myapp.views'\\n\\n\\nWhat happens if you change the URL match to be r'^myview/$'?\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nHave you tried it with the view name? Something like reverse ('myapp.myview')?\\n\\nIs urls.py the root URLconf, or in the myapp application? There needs to be a full path from the root to a view for it to be resolved. If that's myproject/myapp/urls.py, then in myproject/urls.py you'll need code like this:\\n\\nfrom django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns\\nurlpatterns = patterns ('',\\n    (r'^/', 'myapp.urls'),\\n)\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nI\\'m using Python regexes in a criminally inefficient manner\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe first thing that may improve things is to move the re.compile outside the function.

Note that clock behaves different in separate systems:\\n\\n\\non MS Windows, it uses the Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(), with \"resolution typically better than a microsecond\".

Now, this is different, and most probably the value you want, since your program hardly ever is the only process requesting CPU time (even if you have no other processes, the kernel uses CPU time now and then). So, this number, which typically is smaller√Ç¬π than the wall time (i.e. time.time() - t0), is more meaningful when benchmarking code:\\n\\n\\n\\n    # linux\\n    t0= time.clock()\\n    do_something()\\n    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is CPU seconds elapsed (floating point)\\n\\n\\nApart from all that, the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-timeit.html\">timeit module has the Timer class that is supposed to use what\\'s best for benchmarking from the available functionality.\\n\\n√Ç¬π unless threading gets in the way√¢\\x80¬¶\\n\\n√Ç¬≤ Python √¢\\x89¬•3.3: there are <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/#id18\">time.perf_counter() and time.process_time(). perf_counter is being used by the timeit module.\\n',\n \"Question:\\nGet all items from thread Queue\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIf you're always pulling all available items off the queue, is there any real point in using a queue, rather than just a list with a lock?  ie:\\n\\nfrom __future__ import with_statement\\nimport threading\\n\\nclass ItemStore(object):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()\\n        self.items = []\\n\\n    def add(self, item):\\n        with self.lock:\\n            self.items.append(item)\\n\\n    def getAll(self):\\n        with self.lock:\\n            items, self.items = self.items, []\\n        return items\\n\\n\\nIf you're also pulling them individually, and making use of the blocking behaviour for empty queues, then you should use Queue, but your use case looks much simpler, and might be better served by the above approach.\\n\\n[Edit2]  I'd missed the fact that you're polling the queue from an idle loop, and from your update, I see that the problem isn't related to contention, so the below approach isn't really relevant to your problem.

The GNU Emacs 22 python.el won't work on them. On GNU Emacs 22, python.el does work, and ties in better with GNU Emacs's own symbol parsing and completion, ElDoc, etc. I use XEmacs myself, so I don't use it, and I have heard people complain that it didn't work very nicely in the past, but there are updates available that fix some of the issues (for instance, on the emacswiki page you link), and you would hope some were integrated upstream by now. If I were the GNU Emacs kind, I would use python.el until I found specific reasons not to.\\n\\nThe python-mode.el's single biggest problem as far as I've seen is that it doesn't quite understand triple-quoted strings. It treats them as single-quoted, meaning that a single quote inside a triple-quoted string will throw off the syntax highlighting: it'll think the string has ended there. You may also need to change your auto-mode-alist to turn on python-mode for .py files; I don't remember if that's still the case but my init.el has been setting auto-mode-alist for many years now.\\n\\nAs for other addons, nothing I would consider 'essential'. XEmacs's func-menu is sometimes useful, it gives you a little function/class browser menu for the current file. I don't remember if GNU Emacs has anything similar. I have a rst-mode for reStructuredText editing, as that's used in some projects. Tying into whatever VC you use, if any, may be useful to you, but there is builtin support for most and easily downloaded .el files for the others.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nMost pythonic way of counting matching elements in something iterable\\n\\nAnswer:\\nHaving to iterate over the list multiple times isn\\'t elegant IMHO.\\n\\nI\\'d probably create a function that allows doing:\\n\\ntwos, threes = countmatching(xrange(1,10),\\n                             lambda a: a % 2 == 0,\\n                             lambda a: a % 3 == 0)\\n\\n\\nA starting point would be something like this:\\n\\ndef countmatching(iterable, *predicates):\\n    v = [0] * len(predicates)\\n    for e in iterable:\\n        for i,p in enumerate(predicates):\\n            if p(e):\\n                v[i] += 1\\n    return tuple(v)\\n\\n\\nBtw, \"itertools recipes\" has a recipe for doing much like your alt4.\\n\\ndef quantify(seq, pred=None):\\n    \"Count how many times the predicate is true in the sequence\"\\n    return sum(imap(pred, seq))\\n\\n',\n \"Question:\\nAccurate timestamping in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\ntime.clock() only measures wallclock time on Windows. On other systems, time.clock() actually measures CPU-time. On those systems time.time() is more suitable for wallclock time, and it has as high a resolution as Python can manage -- which is as high as the OS can manage; usually using gettimeofday(3) (microsecond resolution) or ftime(3) (millisecond resolution.) Other OS restrictions actually make the real resolution a lot higher than that. datetime.datetime.now() uses time.time(), so time.time() directly won't be better.\\n\\nFor the record, if I use datetime.datetime.now() in a loop, I see about a 1/10000 second resolution. From looking at your data, you have much, much coarser resolution than that. I'm not sure if there's anything Python as such can do, although you may be able to convince the OS to do better through other means.\\n\\nI seem to recall that on Windows, time.clock() is actually (slightly) more accurate than time.time(), but it measures wallclock since the first call to time.clock(), so you have to remember to 'initialize' it first.\\n\",\n \"Question:\\nPython 2.5 dictionary 2 key sort\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou can't sort dictionaries.

That is to say, people will know the attribute (be it a method or a \\'normal\\' data attribute or anything else) is not part of the public API of the object. People will know that to touch it directly is to invite disaster.\\n\\nOn top of that, the double-leading underscore attributes (but not the single-leading underscore attributes) are name-mangled to make accessing them by accident from subclasses or anywhere else outside the current class less likely. You can still access them, but not as trivially. For example:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class ClassA:\\n...     def __init__(self):\\n...         self._single = \"Single\"\\n...         self.__double = \"Double\"\\n...     def getSingle(self):\\n...         return self._single\\n...     def getDouble(self):\\n...         return self.__double\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class ClassB(ClassA):\\n...     def getSingle_B(self):\\n...         return self._single\\n...     def getDouble_B(self):\\n...         return self.__double\\n... \\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ClassA()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ClassB()\\n\\n\\nYou can now trivially access a._single and b._single and get the _single attribute created by ClassA:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a._single, b._single\\n(\\'Single\\', \\'Single\\')\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.getSingle(), b.getSingle(), b.getSingle_B()\\n(\\'Single\\', \\'Single\\', \\'Single\\')\\n\\n\\nBut trying to access the __double attribute on the a or b instance directly won\\'t work:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.__double\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\\nAttributeError: ClassA instance has no attribute \\'__double\\'\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.__double\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\\nAttributeError: ClassB instance has no attribute \\'__double\\'\\n\\n\\nAnd though methods defined in ClassA can get at it directly (when called on either instance):\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.getDouble(), b.getDouble()\\n(\\'Double\\', \\'Double\\')\\n\\n\\nMethods defined on ClassB can not:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.getDouble_B()\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 5, in getDouble_B\\nAttributeError: ClassB instance has no attribute \\'_ClassB__double\\'\\n\\n\\nAnd right in that error you get a hint about what\\'s happening. The __double attribute name, when accessed inside a class, is being name-mangled to include the name of the class that it is being accessed in. When ClassA tries to access self.__double, it actually turns -- at compiletime -- into an access of self._ClassA__double, and likewise for ClassB. (If a method in ClassB were to assign to __double, not included in the code for brevity, it would therefor not touch ClassA\\'s __double but create a new attribute.) There is no other protection of this attribute, so you can still access it directly if you know the right name:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a._ClassA__double, b._ClassA__double\\n(\\'Double\\', \\'Double\\')\\n\\n\\nSo why is this a problem?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s a problem any time you want to inherit and change the behaviour of any code dealing with this attribute. You either have to reimplement everything that touches this double-underscore attribute directly, or you have to guess at the class name and mangle the name manually. The problem gets worse when this double-underscore attribute is actually a method: overriding the method or calling the method in a subclass means doing the name-mangling manually, or reimplementing all the code that calls the method to not use the double-underscore name. Not to mention accessing the attribute dynamically, with getattr(): you will have to manually mangle there, too.\\n\\nOn the other hand, because the attribute is only trivially rewritten, it offers only superficial \\'protection\\'. Any piece of code can still get at the attribute by manually mangling, although that will make their code dependant on the name of your class, and efforts on your side to refactor your code or rename your class (while still keeping the same user-visible name, a common practice in Python) would needlessly break their code. They can also \\'trick\\' Python into doing the name-mangling for them by naming their class the same as yours: notice how there is no module name included in the mangled attribute name. And lastly, the double-underscore attribute is still visible in all attribute lists and all forms of introspection that don\\'t take care to skip attributes starting with a (single) underscore.\\n\\nSo, if you use double-underscore names, use them exceedingly sparingly, as they can turn out quite inconvenient, and never use them for methods or anything else a subclass may ever want to reimplement, override or access directly. And realize that double-leading underscore name-mangling offers no real protection. In the end, using a single leading underscore wins you just as much and gives you less (potential, future) pain.

But more importantly because it introduces a lot of great classes for communicating between processes, such as a Queue class and a Lock class which are each used just like those objects would be in multithreaded code, as well as some other classes for sharing memory between processes.\\n\\nYou can find the documentation at <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython - How do I write a decorator that restores the cwd?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe answer for a decorator has been given; it works at the function definition stage as requested.\\n\\nWith Python 2.5+, you also have an option to do that at the function call stage using a context manager:\\n\\nfrom __future__ import with_statement # needed for 2.5 √¢\\x89¬§ Python &lt; 2.6\\nimport contextlib, os\\n\\n@contextlib.contextmanager\\ndef remember_cwd():\\n    curdir= os.getcwd()\\n    try: yield\\n    finally: os.chdir(curdir)\\n\\n\\nwhich can be used if needed at the function call time as:\\n\\nprint \"getcwd before:\", os.getcwd()\\nwith remember_cwd():\\n    walk_around_the_filesystem()\\nprint \"getcwd after:\", os.getcwd()\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a nice option to have.\\n\\nEDIT: I added error handling as suggested by codeape.

That\\'s an example of something which, if you needed to implement it for a number of models, would benefit from using a pre_save signal, where the signal handler could take the name of the slug field and the name of the field to generate the slug from. Once you have something like that in place, any enhanced functionality you put in place will also apply to all models - e.g. looking up the slug you\\'re about to add for the type of model in question, to ensure uniqueness.\\n\\nReusable applications often benefit from the use of signals - if the functionality they provide can be applied to any model, they generally (unless it\\'s unavoidable) won\\'t want users to have to directly modify their models in order to benefit from it.\\n\\nWith <a href=\"https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/\">django-mptt, for example, I used the pre_save signal to manage a set of fields which describe a tree structure for the model which is about to be created or updated and the pre_delete signal to remove tree structure details for the object being deleted and its entire sub-tree of objects before it and they are deleted. Due to the use of signals, users don\\'t have to add or modify save or delete methods on their models to have this management done for them, they just have to let django-mptt know which models they want it to manage.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nUNIX shell written in a reasonable language?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eshell/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eshell is a Bash-like shell in Emacs Lisp.\\nIPython can be <a href=\"http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/shell.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">used as a system shell, though the syntax is a bit weird (supporting all of Python plus basic sh constructs).\\n<a href=\"http://fishshell.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fish has a core written in C, but much of its functionality is implemented in itself.

I was originally going to blog this, but then I thought: why blog about it when I could get points for it?\\n\\n\\nWait until somebody cares.\\n\\nRight now, nobody has Python 3.  We\\'re not going to spend a bunch of effort until at least one actual user has come forth and said \"I need Python 3.0 support\", and has a good reason for it aside from the fact that 3.0 looks shiny.\\nWait until our dependencies have migrated.\\n\\nA large system like Twisted has a number of dependencies.  For starters, ours include:\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.zope.org/Products/%5AopeInterface\">Zope Interface\\n<a href=\"http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/\">PyCrypto\\n<a href=\"https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/\">PyOpenSSL\\n<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/\">pywin32\\n<a href=\"http://www.pygtk.org/\">PyGTK (though this dependency is sadly very light right now, by the time migration rolls around, I hope Twisted will have more GUI tools)\\n<a href=\"http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/\">pyasn1\\n<a href=\"http://www.pangalactic.org/PyPAM/\">PyPAM\\n<a href=\"http://gmpy.sourceforge.net/\">gmpy\\n\\n\\nSome of these projects have their own array of dependencies so we\\'ll have to wait for those as well.\\nWait until somebody cares enough to help.\\n\\nThere are, charitably, 5 people who work on Twisted - and I say \"charitably\" because that\\'s counting me, and I haven\\'t committed in months.  We have <a href=\"http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/1\">over 1000 open tickets right now, and it would be nice to actually fix some of those √¢\\x80\\x94 fix bugs, add features, and generally make Twisted a better product in its own right √¢\\x80\\x94 before spending time on getting it ported over to a substantially new version of the language.\\n\\nThis potentially includes <a href=\"http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation\">sponsors caring enough to pay for us to do it, but I hope that there will be an influx of volunteers who care about 3.0 support and want to help move the community forward.\\nFollow Guido\\'s advice.\\n\\nThis means <a href=\"http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=227041\">we will not change our API incompatibly, and we will follow the <a href=\"http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=208549\">transitional development guidelines that Guido posted last year.  That starts with having unit tests, and running <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html\">the 2to3 conversion tool over the Twisted codebase.\\nReport bugs against, and file patches for, the 2to3 tool.\\n\\nWhen we get to the point where we\\'re actually using it, I anticipate that there will be a lot of problems with running 2to3 in the future.  Running it over Twisted right now takes an extremely long time and (last I checked, which was quite a while ago) can\\'t parse a few of the files in the Twisted repository, so the resulting output won\\'t import.  I think there will have to be a fair amount of success stories from small projects and a lot of hammering on the tool before it will actually work for us.\\n\\nHowever, the Python development team has been very helpful in responding to our bug reports, and early responses to these problems have been encouraging, so I expect that all of these issues will be fixed in time.\\nMaintain 2.x compatibility for several years.\\n\\nRight now, Twisted supports python 2.3 to 2.5.  Currently, we\\'re working on 2.6 support (which we\\'ll obviously have to finish before 3.0!).  Our plan is to we revise our supported versions of Python based on the long-term supported versions of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu\">Ubuntu - release 8.04, which includes Python 2.5, will be supported until 2013.  According to Guido\\'s advice we will need to drop support for 2.5 in order to support 3.0, but I am hoping we can find a way around that (we are pretty creative with version-compatibility hacks).\\n\\nSo, we are planning to support Python 2.5 until at least 2013.  In two years, Ubuntu will release another long-term supported version of Ubuntu: if they still exist, and stay on schedule, that will be 10.04.  Personally I am guessing that this will ship with Python 2.x, perhaps python 2.8, as /usr/bin/python, because there is a huge amount of Python software packaged with the distribution and it will take a long time to update it all.  So, five years from then, in 2015, we can start looking at dropping 2.x support.\\n\\nDuring this period, we will continue to follow Guido\\'s advice about migration: running 2to3 over our 2.x codebase, and modifying the 2.x codebase to keep its tests passing in both versions.\\n\\nThe upshot of this is that Python 3.x will not be a source language for Twisted until well after my 35th birthday √¢\\x80\\x94 it will be a target runtime (and a set of guidelines and restrictions) for my python 2.x code.  I expect to be writing programs in Python 2.x for the next ten years or so.\\n\\n\\nSo, that\\'s the plan.  I\\'m hoping that it ends up looking laughably conservative in a year or so; that the 3.x transition is easy as pie, and everyone rapidly upgrades.  Other things could happen, too: the 2.x and 3.x branches could converge, someone might end up writing a 3to2, or another runtime (PyPy comes to mind) might allow for running 2.x and 3.x code in the same process directly, making our conversion process easier.\\n\\nFor the time being, however, we\\'re assuming that, for many years, we will have people with large codebases they\\'re maintaining (or people writing new code who want to use other libraries which have not yet been migrated) who still want new features and bug fixes in Twisted.  Pretty soon I expect we will also have bleeding-edge users that want to use Twisted on python 3.

If you need to shrink and grow your array time-efficiently and without hassle, they are the way to go.  But they use a lot more space than C arrays.\\n\\nThe array.array type, on the other hand, is just a thin wrapper on C arrays.  It can hold only homogeneous data, all of the same type, and so it uses only sizeof(one object) * length bytes of memory.  Mostly, you should use it when you need to expose a C array to an extension or a system call (for example, ioctl or fctnl).  It\\'s also a good way to represent a mutable string (array(\\'B\\', bytes)) until that actually becomes available in Python 3.0.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to do math on a homogeneous array of numeric data, then you\\'re much better off using NumPy, which can automatically vectorize operations on complex multi-dimensional arrays.\\n\\nTo make a long story short: array.array is useful when you need a homogeneous C array of data for reasons other than doing math.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nBuilding a full text search engine: where to start\\n\\nAnswer:\\nRead Tim Bray\\'s <a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/30/OnSearchTOC\">series of posts on the subject.\\n\\n\\n  \\n  Background\\n  Usage of search engines\\n  Basics\\n  Precision and recall\\n  Search engne intelligence\\n  Tricky search terms\\n  Stopwords\\n  Metadata\\n  Internationalization\\n  Ranking results\\n  XML\\n  Robots\\n  Requirements list\\n  \\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nFinding the index of an item given a list containing it in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"].index(\"bar\")\\n1\\n\\n\\nReference: <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists\">Data Structures > More on Lists\\n',\n 'Question:\\nAlert boxes in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nwhat about this:\\n\\nimport win32api\\n\\nwin32api.MessageBox(0, \\'hello\\', \\'title\\')\\n\\n\\nAdditionally:\\n\\nwin32api.MessageBox(0, \\'hello\\', \\'title\\', 0x00001000) \\n\\n\\nwill make the box appear on top of other windows, for urgent messages.

You need to keep this in mind in case your application thinks that the remote end received the data from the first write when it may have already disconnected.\\n\\nYou can reduce the incidence (but not entirely eliminate) of this by using select.select() (or poll). Check for data ready to read from the peer before attempting a write. If select reports that there is data available to read from the peer socket, read it using socket.recv(). If this returns an empty string, the remote peer has closed the connection.

There may be security implications to this (think about someone maliciously inserting a symlink to a sensitive file which they wouldn\\'t be able to overwrite, but your program running with a higher privilege could)  Attacks like these are why things like os.tempnam() are deprecated.\\n\\nTo get around it, the best approach is to actually try create the file in such a way that you\\'ll get an exception if it fails, and on success, return the actually opened file object.  This can be done with the lower level os.open functions, by passing both the os.O_CREAT and os.O_EXCL flags.  Once opened, return the actual file (and optionally filename) you create.  Eg, here\\'s your code modified to use this approach (returning a (file, filename) tuple):\\n\\ndef unique_file(file_name):\\n    counter = 1\\n    file_name_parts = os.path.splitext(file_name) # returns (\\'/path/file\\', \\'.ext\\')\\n    while 1:\\n        try:\\n            fd = os.open(file_name, os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL | os.O_RDRW)\\n            return os.fdopen(fd), file_name\\n        except OSError:\\n            pass\\n        file_name = file_name_parts[0] + \\'_\\' + str(counter) + file_name_parts[1]\\n        counter += 1\\n\\n\\n[Edit]  Actually, a better way, which will handle the above issues for you, is probably to use the tempfile module, though you may lose some control over the naming.  Here\\'s an example of using it (keeping a similar interface):\\n\\ndef unique_file(file_name):\\n    dirname, filename = os.path.split(file_name)\\n    prefix, suffix = os.path.splitext(filename)\\n\\n    fd, filename = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix, prefix+\"_\", dirname)\\n    return os.fdopen(fd), filename\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f, filename=unique_file(\\'/home/some_dir/foo.txt\\')\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print filename\\n/home/some_dir/foo_z8f_2Z.txt\\n\\n\\nThe only downside with this approach is that you will always get a filename with some random characters in it, as there\\'s no attempt to create an unmodified file (/home/some_dir/foo.txt) first.\\nYou may also want to look at tempfile.TemporaryFile and NamedTemporaryFile, which will do the above and also automatically delete from disk when closed.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nIn Python, what is the difference between \\'/\\' and \\'//\\' when used for division?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIn Python 3.0, 5 / 2 will return 2.5 and 5 // 2 will return 2.

Calculate the norm of the difference.\\n\\nOption 2: Load both images. Calculate some feature vector for each of them (like a histogram). Calculate distance between feature vectors rather than images.\\n\\nHowever, there are some decisions to make first.\\n\\nQuestions\\n\\nYou should answer these questions first:\\n\\n\\nAre images of the same shape and dimension?\\n\\nIf not, you may need to resize or crop them. PIL library will help to do it in Python.\\n\\nIf they are taken with the same settings and the same device, they are probably the same.\\nAre images well-aligned?\\n\\nIf not, you may want to run cross-correlation first, to find the best alignment first. SciPy has functions to do it.\\n\\nIf the camera and the scene are still, the images are likely to be well-aligned.\\nIs exposure of the images always the same? (Is lightness/contrast the same?)\\n\\nIf not, you may want <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)\">to normalize images.\\n\\nBut be careful, in some situations this may do more wrong than good. For example, a single bright pixel on a dark background will make the normalized image very different.\\nIs color information important?\\n\\nIf you want to notice color changes, you will have a vector of color values per point, rather than a scalar value as in gray-scale image. You need more attention when writing such code.\\nAre there distinct edges in the image? Are they likely to move?\\n\\nIf yes, you can apply edge detection algorithm first (e.g. calculate gradient with Sobel or Prewitt transform, apply some threshold), then compare edges on the first image to edges on the second.\\nIs there noise in the image?\\n\\nAll sensors pollute the image with some amount of noise. Low-cost sensors have more noise. You may wish to apply some noise reduction before you compare images. Blur is the most simple (but not the best) approach here.\\nWhat kind of changes do you want to notice?\\n\\nThis may affect the choice of norm to use for the difference between images.\\n\\nConsider using Manhattan norm (the sum of the absolute values) or zero norm (the number of elements not equal to zero) to measure how much the image has changed. The former will tell you how much the image is off, the latter will tell only how many pixels differ.\\n\\n\\nExample\\n\\nI assume your images are well-aligned, the same size and shape, possibly with different exposure. For simplicity, I convert them to grayscale even if they are color (RGB) images.\\n\\nYou will need these imports:\\n\\nimport sys\\n\\nfrom scipy.misc import imread\\nfrom scipy.linalg import norm\\nfrom scipy import sum, average\\n\\n\\nMain function, read two images, convert to grayscale, compare and print results:\\n\\ndef main():\\n    file1, file2 = sys.argv[1:1+2]\\n    # read images as 2D arrays (convert to grayscale for simplicity)\\n    img1 = to_grayscale(imread(file1).astype(float))\\n    img2 = to_grayscale(imread(file2).astype(float))\\n    # compare\\n    n_m, n_0 = compare_images(img1, img2)\\n    print \"Manhattan norm:\", n_m, \"/ per pixel:\", n_m/img1.size\\n    print \"Zero norm:\", n_0, \"/ per pixel:\", n_0*1.0/img1.size\\n\\n\\nHow to compare. img1 and img2 are 2D SciPy arrays here:\\n\\ndef compare_images(img1, img2):\\n    # normalize to compensate for exposure difference, this may be unnecessary\\n    # consider disabling it\\n    img1 = normalize(img1)\\n    img2 = normalize(img2)\\n    # calculate the difference and its norms\\n    diff = img1 - img2  # elementwise for scipy arrays\\n    m_norm = sum(abs(diff))  # Manhattan norm\\n    z_norm = norm(diff.ravel(), 0)  # Zero norm\\n    return (m_norm, z_norm)\\n\\n\\nIf the file is a color image, imread returns a 3D array, average RGB channels (the last array axis) to obtain intensity. No need to do it for grayscale images (e.g. .pgm):\\n\\ndef to_grayscale(arr):\\n    \"If arr is a color image (3D array), convert it to grayscale (2D array).\"\\n    if len(arr.shape) == 3:\\n        return average(arr, -1)  # average over the last axis (color channels)\\n    else:\\n        return arr\\n\\n\\nNormalization is trivial, you may choose to normalize to [0,1] instead of [0,255]. arr is a SciPy array here, so all operations are element-wise:\\n\\ndef normalize(arr):\\n    rng = arr.max()-arr.min()\\n    amin = arr.min()\\n    return (arr-amin)*255/rng\\n\\n\\nRun the main function:\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    main()\\n\\n\\nNow you can put this all in a script and run against two images. If we compare image to itself, there is no difference:\\n\\n$ python compare.py one.jpg one.jpg\\nManhattan norm: 0.0 / per pixel: 0.0\\nZero norm: 0 / per pixel: 0.0\\n\\n\\nIf we blur the image and compare to the original, there is some difference:\\n\\n$ python compare.py one.jpg one-blurred.jpg \\nManhattan norm: 92605183.67 / per pixel: 13.4210411116\\nZero norm: 6900000 / per pixel: 1.0\\n\\n\\nP.S.

The former teaches to use Background subtraction method, the latter gives some info on optical flow methods. All methods are implemented in OpenCV library. If you use Python, I suggest to use OpenCV √¢\\x89¬• 2.3, and its cv2 Python module.\\n\\nThe most simple version of the background subtraction:\\n\\n\\nlearn the average value √é¬º and standard deviation √è\\x83 for every pixel of the background\\ncompare current pixel values to the range of (√é¬º-2√è\\x83,√é¬º+2√è\\x83) or (√é¬º-√è\\x83,√é¬º+√è\\x83)\\n\\n\\nMore advanced versions make take into account time series for every pixel and handle non-static scenes (like moving trees or grass).\\n\\nThe idea of optical flow is to take two or more frames, and assign velocity vector to every pixel (dense optical flow) or to some of them (sparse optical flow). To estimate sparse optical flow, you may use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Kanade_method\">Lucas-Kanade method (it is also implemented in OpenCV). Obviously, if there is a lot of flow (high average over max values of the velocity field), then something is moving in the frame, and subsequent images are more different.\\n\\nComparing histograms may help to detect sudden changes between consecutive frames. This approach was used in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967066110000808\">Courbon et al, 2010:\\n\\n\\n  Similarity of consecutive frames. The distance between two consecutive frames is measured. If it is too high, it means that the second frame is corrupted and thus the image is eliminated.

These are only useful when the main program is running, and it's okay to kill them off once the other, non-daemon, threads have exited.\\n\\nWithout daemon threads, you'd have to keep track of them, and tell them to exit, before your program can completely quit. By setting them as daemon threads, you can let them run and forget about them, and when your program quits, any daemon threads are killed automatically.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nGetting the pattern back from a compiled re?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou can get it back with\\n\\nx.pattern\\n\\n\\nfrom the Python <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.regex.pattern\">documentation on Regular Expression Objects\\n',\n \"Question:\\nHow to get a complete list of object's methods and attributes?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFor the complete list of attributes, the short answer is: no. The problem is that the attributes are actually defined as the arguments accepted by the getattr built-in function. As the user can reimplement __getattr__, suddenly allowing any kind of attribute, there is no possible generic way to generate that list. The dir function returns the keys in the __dict__ attribute, i.e. all the attributes accessible if the __getattr__ method is not reimplemented.\\n\\nFor the second question, it does not really make sense. Actually, methods are callable attributes, nothing more. You could though filter callable attributes, and, using the inspect module determine the class methods, methods or functions.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nPython Webframework Confusion\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThere are more to it ofcourse.\\n\\nHere\\'s a comprehensive list and details!\\n\\n<a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks\">Web Frameworks for Python\\n\\nExtract from above link:\\n\\n\\n  Popular Full-Stack Frameworks\\n  \\n  A web application may use a\\n  combination of a base HTTP application\\n  server, a storage mechanism such as a\\n  database, a template engine, a request\\n  dispatcher, an authentication module\\n  and an AJAX toolkit.

In Python, all data (classes, methods, functions, etc) defined in C extension modules (including builtins) are immutable. This is because C modules are shared between multiple interpreters in the same process, so monkeypatching them would also affect unrelated interpreters in the same process.\\n\\nHowever, classes defined in Python code may be monkeypatched because they are local to that interpreter.\\n',\n \"Question:\\nXML parsing - ElementTree vs SAX and DOM\\n\\nAnswer:\\nElementTree is much easier to use, because it represents an XML tree (basically) as a structure of lists, and attributes are represented as dictionaries.\\n\\nElementTree needs much less memory for XML trees than DOM (and thus is faster), and the parsing overhead via iterparse is comparable to SAX. Additionally, iterparse returns partial structures, and you can keep memory usage constant during parsing by discarding the structures as soon as you process them.\\n\\nElementTree, as in Python 2.5, has only a small feature set compared to full-blown XML libraries, but it's enough for many applications. If you need a validating parser or complete XPath support, lxml is the way to go. For a long time, it used to be quite unstable, but I haven't had any problems with it since 2.1.\\n\\nElementTree deviates from DOM, where nodes have access to their parent and siblings. Handling actual documents rather than data stores is also a bit cumbersome, because text nodes aren't treated as actual nodes. In the XML snippet\\n\\n&lt;a&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; test&lt;/a&gt;\\n\\n\\nThe string  test will be the so-called tail of element b.\\n\\nIn general, I recommend ElementTree as the default for all XML processing with Python, and DOM or SAX as the solutions for specific problems.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nStandalone Python applications in Linux\\n\\nAnswer:\\nCreate a deb (for everything Debian-derived) and an rpm (for Fedora/SuSE).

Python doesn\\'t have a distinction between /src, /lib, and /bin like Java or C has.\\n\\nSince a top-level /src directory is seen by some as meaningless, your top-level directory can be the top-level architecture of your application.\\n\\n\\n/foo\\n/bar\\n/baz\\n\\n\\nI recommend putting all of this under the \"name-of-my-product\" directory.  So, if you\\'re writing an application named quux, the directory that contains all this stuff is named  /quux.\\n\\nAnother project\\'s PYTHONPATH, then, can include /path/to/quux/foo to reuse the QUUX.foo module.  \\n\\nIn my case, since I use Komodo Edit, my IDE cuft is a single .KPF file.

Then we import the module itself and reference to it in the code:\\n\\nfrom main.core import Exceptions\\n# ...\\nraise Exceptions.FileNotFound()\\n\\n\\nWe use the import X as Y as rarely as possible, because it makes searching for usage of a particular module or class difficult. Sometimes, however, you have to use it if you wish to import two classes that have the same name, but exist in different modules, e.g.:\\n\\nfrom Queue import Queue\\nfrom main.core.MessageQueue import Queue as MessageQueue\\n\\n\\nAs a general rule, we don\\'t do imports inside methods -- they simply make code slower and less readable. Some may find this a good way to easily resolve cyclic imports problem, but a better solution is code reorganization.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nRunning compiled python (py2exe) as administrator in Vista\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFollowing the examples from Python2x\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\py2exe\\\\samples\\\\user_access_control just add uac_info=\"requireAdministrator\" to console or windows dict:\\n\\nwindows = [{\\n    \\'script\\': \"admin.py\",\\n    \\'uac_info\\': \"requireAdministrator\",\\n},]\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython Decimal\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou can try <a href=\"http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/index.html\">cdecimal:\\n\\nfrom cdecimal import Decimal\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nIn production, Apache + mod_wsgi or Nginx + mod_wsgi?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFor nginx/mod_wsgi, ensure you read:\\n\\n<a href=\"http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/05/blocking-requests-and-nginx-version-of.html\">http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/05/blocking-requests-and-nginx-version-of.html\\n\\nBecause of how nginx is an event driven system underneath, it has behavioural characteristics which are detrimental to blocking applications such as is the case with WSGI based applications. Worse case scenario is that with multiprocess nginx configuration, you can see user requests be blocked even though some nginx worker processes may be idle.

Take a look at sys.modules to see the list of cached modules.\\n\\nHowever, if your problem is the time it takes for the first import after the program is run, you'll probably need to use some other method than a python dict.  Probably best would be to use an on-disk form, for instance a sqlite database, one of the dbm modules.\\n\\nFor a minimal change in your interface, the shelve module may be your best option - this puts a pretty transparent interface between the dbm modules that makes them act like an arbitrary python dict, allowing any picklable value to be stored. Here's an example:\\n\\n# Create dict with a million items:\\nimport shelve\\nd = shelve.open('path/to/my_persistant_dict')\\nd.update(('key%d' % x, x) for x in xrange(1000000))\\nd.close()\\n\\n\\nThen in the next process, use it.  There should be no large delay, as lookups are only performed for the key requested on the on-disk form, so everything doesn't have to get loaded into memory:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; d = shelve.open('path/to/my_persistant_dict')\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print d['key99999']\\n99999\\n\\n\\nIt's a bit slower than a real dict, and it will still take a long time to load if you do something that requires all the keys (eg. try to print it), but may solve your problem.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nHow to check if a string in Python is in ASCII?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI think you are not  asking the right question--\\n\\nA string in python has no property corresponding to \\'ascii\\', utf-8, or any other encoding.

These can be got by:\\n\\ndef getRequiredArgs(func):\\n    args, varargs, varkw, defaults = inspect.getargspec(func)\\n    if defaults:\\n        args = args[:-len(defaults)]\\n    return args   # *args and **kwargs are not required, so ignore them.\\n\\n\\nThen a function to tell what you are missing from your particular dict is:\\n\\ndef missingArgs(func, argdict):\\n    return set(getRequiredArgs(func)).difference(argdict)\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, to check for invalid args, use:\\n\\ndef invalidArgs(func, argdict):\\n    args, varargs, varkw, defaults = inspect.getargspec(func)\\n    if varkw: return set()  # All accepted\\n    return set(argdict) - set(args)\\n\\n\\nAnd so a full test if it is callable is :\\n\\ndef isCallableWithArgs(func, argdict):\\n    return not missingArgs(func, argdict) and not invalidArgs(func, argdict)\\n\\n\\n(This is good only as far as python's arg parsing.

Then there\\'s that nasty recursive expression.\\n\\nThe loop is interesting: for m in\\'%d\\'%5**18\\n\\nWhy 5**18? It turns out that \\'%d\\'%5**18 evaluates to \\'3814697265625\\'.  This is a string that has each digit 1-9 at least once, so maybe it\\'s trying to place each of them.  In fact, it looks like this is what r(a[:i]+m+a[i+1:]) is doing: recursively calling r, with the first blank filled in by a digit from that string.  But this only happens if the earlier expression is false.  Let\\'s look at that:\\n\\nm in [(i-j)%9*(i/9^j/9)*(i/27^j/27|i%9/3^j%9/3) or a[j] for j in range(81)]\\n\\nSo the placement is done only if m is not in that monster list.  Each element is either a number (if the first expression is nonzero) or a character (if the first expression is zero).  m is ruled out as a possible substitution if it appears as a character, which can only happen if the first expression is zero.  When is the expression zero?\\n\\nIt has three parts that are multiplied:\\n\\n\\n(i-j)%9 which is zero if i and j are a multiple of 9 apart, i.e. the same column.\\n(i/9^j/9) which is zero if i/9 == j/9, i.e. the same row.\\n(i/27^j/27|i%9/3^j%9/3) which is zero if both of these are zero:\\n\\ni/27^j^27 which is zero if i/27 == j/27, i.e. the same block of three rows\\n\\n\\ni%9/3^j%9/3 which is zero if i%9/3 == j%9/3, i.e. the same block of three columns\\n\\n\\n\\nIf any of these three parts is zero, the entire expression is zero.  In other words, if i and j share a row, column, or 3x3 block, then the value of j can\\'t be used as a candidate for the blank at i.  Aha!\\n\\nfrom sys import exit, argv\\ndef r(a):\\n  i = a.find(\\'0\\')\\n  if i == -1:\\n    exit(a)\\n  for m in \\'3814697265625\\':\\n    okay = True\\n    for j in range(81):\\n      if (i-j)%9 == 0 or (i/9 == j/9) or (i/27 == j/27 and i%9/3 == j%9/3):\\n        if a[j] == m:\\n          okay = False\\n          break\\n    if okay:\\n      # At this point, m is not excluded by any row, column, or block, so let\\'s place it and recurse\\n      r(a[:i]+m+a[i+1:])\\n\\nr(argv[1])\\n\\n\\nNote that if none of the placements work out, r will return and back up to the point where something else can be chosen, so it\\'s a basic depth first algorithm.\\n\\nNot using any heuristics, it\\'s not particularly efficient.

The distinction between \"multiprocessor\" and \"multicore\" computers is probably not relevant to you as an application programmer; it has to do with subtleties of how the cores share access to memory.\\n\\nIn order to take advantage of a multicore (or multiprocessor) computer, you need a program written in such a way that it can be run in parallel, and a runtime that will allow the program to actually be executed in parallel on multiple cores (and operating system, although any operating system you can run on your PC will do this).  This is really parallel programming, although there are different approaches to parallel programming.  The ones that are relevant to Python are multiprocessing and multithreading.\\n\\nIn languages like C, C++, Java, and C#, you can write parallel programs by executing multiple threads.  The global interpreter lock in the CPython and PyPy runtimes preclude this option; but only for those runtimes.  (In my personal opinion, multithreading is <a href=\"http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Ousterhout/Threads/index.shtml\">dangerous and tricky and it is generally a good thing that Python encourages you not to consider it as a way to get a performance advantage.)\\n\\nIf you want to write a parallel program which can run on multiple cores in Python, you have a few different options:\\n\\n\\nWrite a multithreaded program using the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-threading.html\">threading module and run it in the IronPython or Jython runtime.\\nUse the <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing\">processing module, (now included in Python 2.6 as the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html\">multiprocessing module), to run your code in multiple processes at once.\\nUse the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-subprocess.html\">subprocess module to run multiple python interpreters and communicate between them.\\nUse <a href=\"http://twistedmatrix.com/\">Twisted and <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/ampoule/\">Ampoule.  This has the advantage of not just running your code across different processes, but (if you don\\'t share access to things like files) potentially across different computers as well.\\n\\n\\nNo matter which of these options you choose, you will need to understand how to split the work that your program is doing up into chunks that make sense to separate.

Just reading documentation and source code may be a bit boring, so I\\'m taking a hands-on approach here: I\\'m going to add an until statement to Python.\\n\\nAll the coding for this article was done against the cutting-edge Py3k branch in the <a href=\"http://code.python.org/hg/branches/py3k/\">Python Mercurial repository mirror.\\n\\nThe until statement\\n\\nSome languages, like Ruby, have an until statement, which is the complement to while (until num == 0 is equivalent to while num != 0). In Ruby, I can write:\\n\\nnum = 3\\nuntil num == 0 do\\n  puts num\\n  num -= 1\\nend\\n\\n\\nAnd it will print:\\n\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n\\n\\nSo, I want to add a similar capability to Python. That is, being able to write:\\n\\nnum = 3\\nuntil num == 0:\\n  print(num)\\n  num -= 1\\n\\n\\nA language-advocacy digression\\n\\nThis article doesn\\'t attempt to suggest the addition of an until statement to Python. Although I think such a statement would make some code clearer, and this article displays how easy it is to add, I completely respect Python\\'s philosophy of minimalism. All I\\'m trying to do here, really, is gain some insight into the inner workings of Python.\\n\\nModifying the grammar\\n\\nPython uses a custom parser generator named pgen. This is a LL(1) parser that converts Python source code into a parse tree. The input to the parser generator is the file Grammar/Grammar[1]. This is a simple text file that specifies the grammar of Python.\\n\\n[1]: From here on, references to files in the Python source are given relatively to the root of the source tree, which is the directory where you run configure and make to build Python.\\n\\nTwo modifications have to be made to the grammar file. The first is to add a definition for the until statement. I found where the while statement was defined (while_stmt), and added until_stmt below [2]:\\n\\ncompound_stmt: if_stmt | while_stmt | until_stmt | for_stmt | try_stmt | with_stmt | funcdef | classdef | decorated\\nif_stmt: \\'if\\' test \\':\\' suite (\\'elif\\' test \\':\\' suite)* [\\'else\\' \\':\\' suite]\\nwhile_stmt: \\'while\\' test \\':\\' suite [\\'else\\' \\':\\' suite]\\nuntil_stmt: \\'until\\' test \\':\\' suite\\n\\n\\n[2]: This demonstrates a common technique I use when modifying source code I√¢\\x80\\x99m not familiar with: work by similarity. This principle won√¢\\x80\\x99t solve all your problems, but it can definitely ease the process. Since everything that has to be done for while also has to be done for until, it serves as a pretty good guideline.\\n\\nNote that I\\'ve decided to exclude the else clause from my definition of until, just to make it a little bit different (and because frankly I dislike the else clause of loops and don\\'t think it fits well with the Zen of Python).\\n\\nThe second change is to modify the rule for compound_stmt to include until_stmt, as you can see in the snippet above. It\\'s right after while_stmt, again.\\n\\nWhen you run make after modifying Grammar/Grammar, notice that the pgen program is run to re-generate Include/graminit.h and Python/graminit.c, and then several files get re-compiled.\\n\\nModifying the AST generation code\\n\\nAfter the Python parser has created a parse tree, this tree is converted into an AST, since ASTs are <a href=\"http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/02/16/abstract-vs-concrete-syntax-trees/\">much simpler to work with in subsequent stages of the compilation process.\\n\\nSo, we\\'re going to visit Parser/Python.asdl which defines the structure of Python\\'s ASTs and add an AST node for our new until statement, again right below the while:\\n\\n| While(expr test, stmt* body, stmt* orelse)\\n| Until(expr test, stmt* body)\\n\\n\\nIf you now run make, notice that before compiling a bunch of files, Parser/asdl_c.py is run to generate C code from the AST definition file. This (like Grammar/Grammar) is another example of the Python source-code using a mini-language (in other words, a DSL) to simplify programming. Also note that since Parser/asdl_c.py is a Python script, this is a kind of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28compilers%29\">bootstrapping - to build Python from scratch, Python already has to be available.\\n\\nWhile Parser/asdl_c.py generated the code to manage our newly defined AST node (into the files Include/Python-ast.h and Python/Python-ast.c), we still have to write the code that converts a relevant parse-tree node into it by hand. This is done in the file Python/ast.c. There, a function named ast_for_stmt converts parse tree nodes for statements into AST nodes. Again, guided by our old friend while, we jump right into the big switch for handling compound statements and add a clause for until_stmt:\\n\\ncase while_stmt:\\n    return ast_for_while_stmt(c, ch);\\ncase until_stmt:\\n    return ast_for_until_stmt(c, ch);\\n\\n\\nNow we should implement ast_for_until_stmt. Here it is:\\n\\nstatic stmt_ty\\nast_for_until_stmt(struct compiling *c, const node *n)\\n{\\n    /* until_stmt: \\'until\\' test \\':\\' suite */\\n    REQ(n, until_stmt);\\n\\n    if (NCH(n) == 4) {\\n        expr_ty expression;\\n        asdl_seq *suite_seq;\\n\\n        expression = ast_for_expr(c, CHILD(n, 1));\\n        if (!expression)\\n            return NULL;\\n        suite_seq = ast_for_suite(c, CHILD(n, 3));\\n        if (!suite_seq)\\n            return NULL;\\n        return Until(expression, suite_seq, LINENO(n), n-&gt;n_col_offset, c-&gt;c_arena);\\n    }\\n\\n    PyErr_Format(PyExc_SystemError,\\n                 \"wrong number of tokens for \\'until\\' statement: %d\",\\n                 NCH(n));\\n    return NULL;\\n}\\n\\n\\nAgain, this was coded while closely looking at the equivalent ast_for_while_stmt, with the difference that for until I\\'ve decided not to support the else clause. As expected, the AST is created recursively, using other AST creating functions like ast_for_expr for the condition expression and ast_for_suite for the body of the until statement. Finally, a new node named Until is returned.\\n\\nNote that we access the parse-tree node n using some macros like NCH and CHILD. These are worth understanding - their code is in Include/node.h.\\n\\nDigression: AST composition\\n\\nI chose to create a new type of AST for the until statement, but actually this isn\\'t necessary. I could\\'ve saved some work and implemented the new functionality using composition of existing AST nodes, since:\\n\\nuntil condition:\\n   # do stuff\\n\\n\\nIs functionally equivalent to:\\n\\nwhile not condition:\\n  # do stuff\\n\\n\\nInstead of creating the Until node in ast_for_until_stmt, I could have created a Not node with an While node as a child. Since the AST compiler already knows how to handle these nodes, the next steps of the process could be skipped.\\n\\nCompiling ASTs into bytecode\\n\\nThe next step is compiling the AST into Python bytecode. The compilation has an intermediate result which is a CFG (Control Flow Graph), but since the same code handles it I will ignore this detail for now and leave it for another article.\\n\\nThe code we will look at next is Python/compile.c. Following the lead of while, we find the function compiler_visit_stmt, which is responsible for compiling statements into bytecode. We add a clause for Until:\\n\\ncase While_kind:\\n    return compiler_while(c, s);\\ncase Until_kind:\\n    return compiler_until(c, s);\\n\\n\\nIf you wonder what Until_kind is, it\\'s a constant (actually a value of the _stmt_kind enumeration) automatically generated from the AST definition file into Include/Python-ast.h. Anyway, we call compiler_until which, of course, still doesn\\'t exist. I\\'ll get to it an a moment.\\n\\nIf you\\'re curious like me, you\\'ll notice that compiler_visit_stmt is peculiar. No amount of grep-ping the source tree reveals where it is called. When this is the case, only one option remains - C macro-fu. Indeed, a short investigation leads us to the VISIT macro defined in Python/compile.c:\\n\\n#define VISIT(C, TYPE, V) {\\\\\\n    if (!compiler_visit_ ## TYPE((C), (V))) \\\\\\n        return 0; \\\\\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s used to invoke compiler_visit_stmt in compiler_body. Back to our business, however...\\n\\nAs promised, here\\'s compiler_until:\\n\\nstatic int\\ncompiler_until(struct compiler *c, stmt_ty s)\\n{\\n    basicblock *loop, *end, *anchor = NULL;\\n    int constant = expr_constant(s-&gt;v.Until.test);\\n\\n    if (constant == 1) {\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n    loop = compiler_new_block(c);\\n    end = compiler_new_block(c);\\n    if (constant == -1) {\\n        anchor = compiler_new_block(c);\\n        if (anchor == NULL)\\n            return 0;\\n    }\\n    if (loop == NULL || end == NULL)\\n        return 0;\\n\\n    ADDOP_JREL(c, SETUP_LOOP, end);\\n    compiler_use_next_block(c, loop);\\n    if (!compiler_push_fblock(c, LOOP, loop))\\n        return 0;\\n    if (constant == -1) {\\n        VISIT(c, expr, s-&gt;v.Until.test);\\n        ADDOP_JABS(c, POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE, anchor);\\n    }\\n    VISIT_SEQ(c, stmt, s-&gt;v.Until.body);\\n    ADDOP_JABS(c, JUMP_ABSOLUTE, loop);\\n\\n    if (constant == -1) {\\n        compiler_use_next_block(c, anchor);\\n        ADDOP(c, POP_BLOCK);\\n    }\\n    compiler_pop_fblock(c, LOOP, loop);\\n    compiler_use_next_block(c, end);\\n\\n    return 1;\\n}\\n\\n\\nI have a confession to make: this code wasn\\'t written based on a deep understanding of Python bytecode. Like the rest of the article, it was done in imitation of the kin compiler_while function. By reading it carefully, however, keeping in mind that the Python VM is stack-based, and glancing into the documentation of the dis module, which has <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/dis.html\">a list of Python bytecodes with descriptions, it\\'s possible to understand what\\'s going on.\\n\\nThat\\'s it, we\\'re done... Aren\\'t we?\\n\\nAfter making all the changes and running make, we can run the newly compiled Python and try our new until statement:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; until num == 0:\\n...   print(num)\\n...   num -= 1\\n...\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n\\n\\nVoila, it works! Let\\'s see the bytecode created for the new statement by using the dis module as follows:\\n\\nimport dis\\n\\ndef myfoo(num):\\n    until num == 0:\\n        print(num)\\n        num -= 1\\n\\ndis.dis(myfoo)\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s the result:\\n\\n4           0 SETUP_LOOP              36 (to 39)\\n      &gt;&gt;    3 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\\n            6 LOAD_CONST               1 (0)\\n            9 COMPARE_OP               2 (==)\\n           12 POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE        38\\n\\n5          15 LOAD_NAME                0 (print)\\n           18 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\\n           21 CALL_FUNCTION            1\\n           24 POP_TOP\\n\\n6          25 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\\n           28 LOAD_CONST               2 (1)\\n           31 INPLACE_SUBTRACT\\n           32 STORE_FAST               0 (num)\\n           35 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            3\\n      &gt;&gt;   38 POP_BLOCK\\n      &gt;&gt;   39 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)\\n           42 RETURN_VALUE\\n\\n\\nThe most interesting operation is number 12: if the condition is true, we jump to after the loop. This is correct semantics for until. If the jump isn\\'t executed, the loop body keeps running until it jumps back to the condition at operation 35.\\n\\nFeeling good about my change, I then tried running the function (executing myfoo(3)) instead of showing its bytecode. The result was less than encouraging:\\n\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"zy.py\", line 9, in\\n    myfoo(3)\\n  File \"zy.py\", line 5, in myfoo\\n    print(num)\\nSystemError: no locals when loading \\'print\\'\\n\\n\\nWhoa... this can\\'t be good. So what went wrong?\\n\\nThe case of the missing symbol table\\n\\nOne of the steps the Python compiler performs when compiling the AST is create a symbol table for the code it compiles. The call to PySymtable_Build in PyAST_Compile calls into the symbol table module (Python/symtable.c), which walks the AST in a manner similar to the code generation functions. Having a symbol table for each scope helps the compiler figure out some key information, such as which variables are global and which are local to a scope.\\n\\nTo fix the problem, we have to modify the symtable_visit_stmt function in Python/symtable.c, adding code for handling until statements, after the similar code for while statements [3]:\\n\\ncase While_kind:\\n    VISIT(st, expr, s-&gt;v.While.test);\\n    VISIT_SEQ(st, stmt, s-&gt;v.While.body);\\n    if (s-&gt;v.While.orelse)\\n        VISIT_SEQ(st, stmt, s-&gt;v.While.orelse);\\n    break;\\ncase Until_kind:\\n    VISIT(st, expr, s-&gt;v.Until.test);\\n    VISIT_SEQ(st, stmt, s-&gt;v.Until.body);\\n    break;\\n\\n\\n[3]: By the way, without this code there√¢\\x80\\x99s a compiler warning for Python/symtable.c. The compiler notices that the Until_kind enumeration value isn√¢\\x80\\x99t handled in the switch statement of symtable_visit_stmt and complains. It√¢\\x80\\x99s always important to check for compiler warnings!\\n\\nAnd now we really are done. Compiling the source after this change makes the execution of myfoo(3) work as expected.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article I\\'ve demonstrated how to add a new statement to Python. Albeit requiring quite a bit of tinkering in the code of the Python compiler, the change wasn\\'t difficult to implement, because I used a similar and existing statement as a guideline.\\n\\nThe Python compiler is a sophisticated chunk of software, and I don\\'t claim being an expert in it. However, I am really interested in the internals of Python, and particularly its front-end. Therefore, I found this exercise a very useful companion to theoretical study of the compiler\\'s principles and source code.

Transactions can only affect entities inside a single entity group.\\nAll writes to a single entity group are serialized, so throughput is limited.\\nThe parent entity is set on creation and is fixed. References can be changed at any time.\\nWith reference properties, you can only query for direct relationships, but with parent properties you can use the .ancestor() filter to find everything (directly or indirectly) descended from a given ancestor.\\nEach entity has only a single parent, but can have multiple reference properties.\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nWhat is the purpose of the colon before a block in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe colon is there to declare the start of an indented block.\\n\\nTechnically, it\\'s not necessary; you could just indent and de-indent when the block is done. However, based on the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\">Python koan √¢\\x80\\x9cexplicit is better than implicit√¢\\x80\\x9d (EIBTI), I believe that Guido deliberately made the colon obligatory, so any statement that should be followed by indented code ends in a colon. (It also allows one-liners if you continue after the colon, but this style is not in wide use.)\\n\\nIt also makes the work of syntax-aware auto-indenting editors easier, which also counted in the decision.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis question turns out to be a <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/faq/design.html#why-are-colons-required-for-the-if-while-def-class-statements\">Python FAQ, and I found one of its answers by Guido <a href=\"http://markmail.org/message/ve7mwqxhci4pm6lw\">here:\\n\\n\\n  Why are colons required for the if/while/def/class statements?\\n  \\n  The colon is required primarily to enhance readability (one of the results of the experimental ABC language). Consider this:\\n\\nif a == b \\n    print a\\n\\n  \\n  versus \\n\\nif a == b: \\n    print a\\n\\n  \\n  Notice how the second one is slightly easier to read. Notice further how a colon sets off the example in this FAQ answer; it√¢\\x80\\x99s a standard usage in English.\\n  \\n  Another minor reason is that the colon makes it easier for editors with syntax highlighting; they can look for colons to decide when indentation needs to be increased instead of having to do a more elaborate parsing of the program text.\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nWhy Python decorators rather than closures?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nWhile it is true that syntactically, decorators are just \"sugar\", that is not the best way to think about them.\\n\\nDecorators allow you to weave functionality into your existing code without actually modifying it. And they allow you to do it in a way that is declarative.\\n\\nThis allows you to use decorators to do aspect-oriented programming (AOP). So you want to use a decorator when you have a cross-cutting concern that you want to encapsulate in one place. \\n\\nThe quintessential example would probably be logging, where you want to log the entry or exit of a function, or both. Using a decorator is equivalent to applying advice (log this!) to a joinpoint (during method entry or exit).\\n\\nMethod decoration is a concept like OOP or list comprehensions. As you point out, it is not always appropriate, and can be overused. But in the right place, it can be useful for making code more modular and decoupled.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython embedded in CPP: how to get data back to CPP\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFirst of all, change your function to return the value. printing it will complicate things since you want to get the value back.

It gets an HTTP request.  It parses the request to find a way to respond.  Apache has a LOT of choices for responding.   One way to respond is to use CGI to run a script.  Another way to respond is to simply serve a file.  \\n\\nIn the case of CGI, Apache prepares an environment and invokes the script through the CGI protocol.  This is a standard Unix Fork/Exec situation -- the CGI subprocess inherits an OS environment including the socket and stdout.  The CGI subprocess writes a response, which goes back to Apache; Apache sends this response to the browser.\\n\\nCGI is primitive and annoying.  Mostly because it forks a subprocess for every request, and subprocess must exit or close stdout and stderr to signify end of response.\\n\\nWSGI is an interface that is based on the CGI design pattern.  It is not necessarily CGI -- it does not have to fork a subprocess for each request.  It can be CGI, but it doesn\\'t have to be.\\n\\nWSGI adds to the CGI design pattern in several important ways.  It parses the HTTP Request Headers for you and adds these to the environment.  It supplies any POST-oriented input as a file-like object in the environment.  It also provides you a function that will formulate the response, saving you from a lot of formatting details.\\n\\nWhat do I need to know / install / do if I want to run a web framework (say web.py or cherrypy) on my basic CGI configuration ?\\n\\nRecall that forking a subprocess is expensive.  There are two ways to work around this.\\n\\n\\nEmbedded mod_wsgi or mod_python embeds Python inside Apache; no process is forked.  Apache runs the Django application directly.\\nDaemon mod_wsgi or mod_fastcgi allows Apache to interact with a separate daemon (or \"long-running process\"), using the WSGI protocol.  You start your long-running Django process, then you configure Apache\\'s mod_fastcgi to communicate with this process.\\n\\n\\nNote that mod_wsgi can work in either mode: embedded or daemon.\\n\\nWhen you read up on mod_fastcgi, you\\'ll see that Django uses <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup/\">flup to create a WSGI-compatible interface from the information provided by mod_fastcgi.  The pipeline works like this.\\n\\nApache -&gt; mod_fastcgi -&gt; FLUP (via FastCGI protocol) -&gt; Django (via WSGI protocol)\\n\\n\\nDjango has several \"django.core.handlers\" for the various interfaces.\\n\\nFor mod_fastcgi, Django provides a manage.py runfcgi that integrates FLUP and the handler.\\n\\nFor mod_wsgi, there\\'s a core handler for this.\\n\\nHow to install WSGI support ?\\n\\nFollow these instructions.\\n\\n<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango\">http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango\\n\\nFor background see this\\n\\n<a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/#howto-deployment-index\">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/#howto-deployment-index\\n',\n 'Question:\\nEnsure a single instance of an application in Linux\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe Right Thing is advisory locking using flock(LOCK_EX); in Python, this is found in the <A HREF=\"http://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html\">fcntl module.\\n\\nUnlike pidfiles, these locks are always automatically released when your process dies for any reason, have no race conditions exist relating to file deletion (as the file doesn\\'t need to be deleted to release the lock), and there\\'s no chance of a different process inheriting the PID and thus appearing to validate a stale lock.\\n\\nIf you want unclean shutdown detection, you can write a marker (such as your PID, for traditionalists) into the file after grabbing the lock, and then truncate the file to 0-byte status before a clean shutdown (while the lock is being held); thus, if the lock is not held and the file is non-empty, an unclean shutdown is indicated.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nIncluding PYDs/DLLs in py2exe builds\\n\\nAnswer:\\n.pyd\\'s and .DLL\\'s are different here, in that a .pyd ought to be automatically found by modulefinder and so included (as long as you have the appropriate \"import\" statement) without needing to do anything.

They can call any single-parameter function in that namespace just by providing the name.  You can help guard against this with a few checks (eg. isinstance(SomeBaseClass, theClass), but its probably better to avoid this approach.  Another disadvantage is that it constrains your class placement.  If you end up with dozens of such classes and decide to group them into modules, your lookup code will stop working.\\n\\nYou have several alternative options:\\n\\n\\nCreate an explicit mapping:\\n\\n class_lookup = {\\'Class1\\' : Class1, ... }\\n ...\\n result = class_lookup[className](param).html\\n\\n\\nthough this has the disadvantage that you have to re-list all the classes.\\nNest the classes in an enclosing scope.  Eg. define them within their own module, or within an outer class:\\n\\nclass Namespace(object):\\n    class Class1(object):\\n        ...\\n    class Class2(object):\\n        ...\\n...\\nresult = getattr(Namespace, className)(param).html\\n\\n\\nYou do inadvertantly expose a couple of additional class variables here though (__bases__, __getattribute__ etc) - probably not exploitable, but not perfect.\\nConstruct a lookup dict from the subclass tree.  Make all your classes inherit from a single baseclass.  When all classes have been created, examine all baseclasses and populate a dict from them.  This has the advantage that you can define your classes anywhere (eg. in seperate modules), and so long as you create the registry after all are created, you will find them.\\n\\ndef register_subclasses(base):\\n    d={}\\n    for cls in base.__subclasses__():\\n        d[cls.__name__] = cls\\n        d.update(register_subclasses(cls))\\n    return d\\n\\n\\nclass_lookup = register_subclasses(MyBaseClass)\\n\\n\\nA more advanced variation on the above is to use self-registering classes - create a metaclass than automatically registers any created classes in a dict.  This is probably overkill for this case - its useful in some \"user-plugins\" scenarios though.\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nElementTree XPath - Select Element based on attribute\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe syntax you\\'re trying to use is new in <a href=\"http://effbot.org/zone/element-xpath.htm\">ElementTree 1.3.\\n\\nSuch version is shipped with Python 2.7 or higher.\\nIf you have Python 2.6 or less you still have ElementTree 1.2.6 or less.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nSorting a tuple that contains tuples\\n\\nAnswer:\\nfrom operator import itemgetter\\n\\nMY_SORTED_TUPLE = tuple(sorted(MY_TUPLE, key=itemgetter(1)))\\n\\n\\nor without itemgetter:\\n\\nMY_SORTED_TUPLE = tuple(sorted(MY_TUPLE, key=lambda item: item[1]))\\n\\n',\n \"Question:\\nHow to use 'super' in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe benefits of super() in single-inheritance are minimal -- mostly, you don't have to hard-code the name of the base class into every method that uses its parent methods.\\n\\nHowever, it's almost impossible to use multiple-inheritance without super().

It looks like your files have embedded line breaks so typically what we\\'ll do here is make the line your unit of decomposition, applying per-line regexes. Meanwhile, you create a small state machine and use regex matches to trigger transitions in that state machine. This way you know where you are in the file, and what types of character data you can expect. Also, consider using named capture groups and loading the regexes from an external file. That way if the format of your transcript changes, it\\'s a simple matter of tweaking the regex, rather than writing new parse-specific code.\\n',\n \"Question:\\nHow do I perform query filtering in django templates\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou can't do this, which is by design.  The Django framework authors intended a strict separation of presentation code from data logic.  Filtering models is data logic, and outputting HTML is presentation logic.\\n\\nSo you have several options.  The easiest is to do the filtering, then pass the result to render_to_response.  Or you could write a method in your model so that you can say {% for object in data.filtered_set %}.  Finally, you could write your own template tag, although in this specific case I would advise against that.\\n\",\n \"Question:\\nJavascript style dot notation for dictionary keys unpythonic?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYour DictObj example is actually quite common. Object-style dot-notation access can be a win if you are dealing with √¢\\x80\\x98things that resemble objects√¢\\x80\\x99, ie. they have fixed property names containing only characters valid in Python identifiers. Stuff like database rows or form submissions can be usefully stored in this kind of object, making code a little more readable without the excess of ['item access'].\\n\\nThe implementation is a bit limited - you don't get the nice constructor syntax of dict, len(), comparisons, 'in', iteration or nice reprs.

And before generators come iterables.\\n\\nIterables\\n\\nWhen you create a list, you can read its items one by one. Reading its items one by one is called iteration:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [1, 2, 3]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mylist:\\n...    print(i)\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n\\n\\nmylist is an iterable. When you use a list comprehension, you create a list, and so an iterable:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mylist:\\n...    print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\n\\n\\nEverything you can use \"for... in...\" on is an iterable; lists, strings, files...\\n\\nThese iterables are handy because you can read them as much as you wish, but you store all the values in memory and this is not always what you want when you have a lot of values.\\n\\nGenerators\\n\\nGenerators are iterators, but you can only iterate over them once. It\\'s because they do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mygenerator:\\n...    print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\n\\n\\nIt is just the same except you used () instead of []. BUT, you cannot perform for i in mygenerator a second time since generators can only be used once: they calculate 0, then forget about it and calculate 1, and end calculating 4, one by one.\\n\\nYield\\n\\nYield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def createGenerator():\\n...    mylist = range(3)\\n...    for i in mylist:\\n...        yield i*i\\n...\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mygenerator = createGenerator() # create a generator\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(mygenerator) # mygenerator is an object!\\n&lt;generator object createGenerator at 0xb7555c34&gt;\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in mygenerator:\\n...     print(i)\\n0\\n1\\n4\\n\\n\\nHere it\\'s a useless example, but it\\'s handy when you know your function will return a huge set of values that you will only need to read once.\\n\\nTo master yield, you must understand that when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run. The function only returns the generator object, this is a bit tricky :-)\\n\\nThen, your code will be run each time the for uses the generator.\\n\\nNow the hard part:\\n\\nThe first time the for calls the generator object created from your function, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits yield, then it\\'ll return the first value of the loop. Then, each other call will run the loop you have written in the function one more time, and return the next value, until there is no value to return.\\n\\nThe generator is considered empty once the function runs but does not hit yield anymore. It can be because the loop had come to an end, or because you do not satisfy an \"if/else\" anymore.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour code explained\\n\\nGenerator:\\n\\n# Here you create the method of the node object that will return the generator\\ndef node._get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):\\n\\n  # Here is the code that will be called each time you use the generator object:\\n\\n  # If there is still a child of the node object on its left\\n  # AND if distance is ok, return the next child\\n  if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist &lt; self._median:\\n      yield self._leftchild\\n\\n  # If there is still a child of the node object on its right\\n  # AND if distance is ok, return the next child\\n  if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist &gt;= self._median:\\n      yield self._rightchild\\n\\n  # If the function arrives here, the generator will be considered empty\\n  # there is no more than two values: the left and the right children\\n\\n\\nCaller:\\n\\n# Create an empty list and a list with the current object reference\\nresult, candidates = list(), [self]\\n\\n# Loop on candidates (they contain only one element at the beginning)\\nwhile candidates:\\n\\n    # Get the last candidate and remove it from the list\\n    node = candidates.pop()\\n\\n    # Get the distance between obj and the candidate\\n    distance = node._get_dist(obj)\\n\\n    # If distance is ok, then you can fill the result\\n    if distance &lt;= max_dist and distance &gt;= min_dist:\\n        result.extend(node._values)\\n\\n    # Add the children of the candidate in the candidates list\\n    # so the loop will keep running until it will have looked\\n    # at all the children of the children of the children, etc. of the candidate\\n    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))\\n\\nreturn result\\n\\n\\nThis code contains several smart parts:\\n\\n\\nThe loop iterates on a list but the list expands while the loop is being iterated :-) It\\'s a concise way to go through all these nested data even if it\\'s a bit dangerous since you can end up with an infinite loop. In this case, candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist)) exhausts all the values of the generator, but while keeps creating new generator objects which will produce different values from the previous ones since it\\'s not applied on the same node.\\nThe extend() method is a list object method that expects an iterable and adds its values to the list.\\n\\n\\nUsually we pass a list to it:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [3, 4]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a)\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\n\\n\\nBut in your code it gets a generator, which is good because:\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to read the values twice.\\nYou may have a lot of children and you don\\'t want them all stored in memory.\\n\\n\\nAnd it works because Python does not care if the argument of a method is a list or not. Python expects iterables so it will work with strings, lists, tuples and generators! This is called duck typing and is one of the reason why Python is so cool.

For Python, it means:\\n\\n\\nDuck typing : no type checking. Only behavior matters. Therefore your code must be designed to use this feature. A good design means generic signatures, no dependences between components, high abstraction levels.. So if you change anything, you won\\'t have to change the rest of the code. Python will not complain either, that what it has been built for. Types are not an issue.\\nHuge standard library. You do not need to change all your calls in the program if you use standard features you haven\\'t coded yourself. And Python come with batteries included. I keep discovering them everyday. I had no idea of the number of modules I could use when I started and tried to rewrite existing stuff like everybody. It\\'s OK, you can\\'t get it all right from the beginning.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t write Java, C++, Python, PHP, Erlang, whatever, the same way. They are good reasons why there is room for each of so many different languages, they do not do the same things.\\n\\nUnit tests are not a substitute\\n\\nUnit tests must be performed with any language. The most famous unit test library (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit\">JUnit) is from the Java world!\\n\\nThis has nothing to do with types. You check behaviors, again. You avoid trouble with regression. You ensure your customer you are on tracks.\\n\\nPython for large scale projects\\n\\n\\n  Languages, libraries and frameworks\\n  don\\'t scale. Architectures do.\\n\\n\\nIf you design a solid architecture, if you are able to make it evolves quickly, then it will scale. Unit tests help, automatic code check as well. But they are just safety nets. And small ones.\\n\\nPython is especially suitable for large projects because it enforces some good practices and has a lot of usual design patterns built-in. But again, do not use it for what it is not designed. E.g : Python is not a technology for CPU intensive tasks.\\n\\nIn a huge project, you will most likely use several different technologies anyway. As a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/980813/what-is-sgbd\">SGBD and a templating language, or else. Python is no exception.\\n\\nYou will probably want to use C/C++ for the part of your code you need to be fast. Or Java to fit in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat\">Tomcat environment. Don\\'t know, don\\'t care. Python can play well with these.\\n\\nAs a conclusion\\n\\nMy answer may feel a bit rude, but don\\'t get me wrong: this is a very good question.\\n\\nA lot of people come to Python with old habits.

It\\'s a scripting language.  And, Python modules compose into larger aggregates very simply.\\nCoding is in flux because requirements and design keep changing.  It\\'s scripted -- not compiled.  You just make a change to the code and you\\'re off and running.  Testing is easier because the work cycle is shorter.

This has been, by far, the easiest way I\\'ve found for doing what you ask.\\n\\nimport ctypes\\n\\n# Load DLL into memory.\\n\\nhllDll = ctypes.WinDLL (\"c:\\\\\\\\PComm\\\\\\\\ehlapi32.dll\")\\n\\n# Set up prototype and parameters for the desired function call.\\n# HLLAPI\\n\\nhllApiProto = ctypes.WINFUNCTYPE (\\n    ctypes.c_int,      # Return type.\\n    ctypes.c_void_p,   # Parameters 1 ...\\n    ctypes.c_void_p,\\n    ctypes.c_void_p,\\n    ctypes.c_void_p)   # ... thru 4.\\nhllApiParams = (1, \"p1\", 0), (1, \"p2\", 0), (1, \"p3\",0), (1, \"p4\",0),\\n\\n# Actually map the call (\"HLLAPI(...)\") to a Python name.\\n\\nhllApi = hllApiProto ((\"HLLAPI\", hllDll), hllApiParams)\\n\\n# This is how you can actually call the DLL function.\\n# Set up the variables and call the Python name with them.\\n\\np1 = ctypes.c_int (1)\\np2 = ctypes.c_char_p (sessionVar)\\np3 = ctypes.c_int (1)\\np4 = ctypes.c_int (0)\\nhllApi (ctypes.byref (p1), p2, ctypes.byref (p3), ctypes.byref (p4))\\n\\n\\nThe ctypes stuff has all the C-type data types (int, char, short, void*, and so on) and can pass by value or reference.  It can also return specific data types although my example doesn\\'t do that (the HLL API returns values by modifying a variable passed by reference).\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of the specific example shown above, IBM\\'s EHLLAPI is a fairly consistent interface.\\n\\nAll calls pass four void pointers (EHLLAPI sends the return code back through the fourth parameter, a pointer to an int so, while I specify int as the return type, I can safely ignore it) as per IBM\\'s documentation <a href=\"http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pcomhelp/v5r9/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.pcomm.doc/books/html/emulator_programming08.htm\">here. In other words, the C variant of the function would be:\\n\\nint hllApi (void *p1, void *p2, void *p3, void *p4)\\n\\n\\nThis makes for a single, simple ctypes function able to do anything the EHLLAPI library provides, but it\\'s likely that other libraries will need a separate ctypes function set up per library function.\\n\\nThe return value from WINFUNCTYPE is a function prototype but you still have to set up more  parameter information (over and above the types). Each tuple in hllApiParams has a parameter \"direction\" (1 = input, 2 = output and so on), a parameter name and a default value - see the ctypes doco for details\\n\\nOnce you have the prototype and parameter information, you can create a Python \"callable\" hllApi with which to call the function. You simply create the needed variable (p1 through p4 in my case) and call the function with them.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nappend vs. extend\\n\\nAnswer:\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html?#array.array.append\">append: Appends object at end.\\n\\nx = [1, 2, 3]\\nx.append([4, 5])\\nprint (x)\\n\\n\\ngives you: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]\\n\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html?#array.array.extend\">extend: Extends list by appending elements from the iterable.\\n\\nx = [1, 2, 3]\\nx.extend([4, 5])\\nprint (x)\\n\\n\\ngives you: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\n',\n 'Question:\\nWhat Python bindings are there for CVS or SVN?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nFor cvs, <a href=\"http://pycvs.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyCVS may be worth a look.\\n\\nFor svn, there is <a href=\"http://pysvn.tigris.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pysvn, which is pretty good.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nIn Python, is there a concise way of comparing whether the contents of two text files are the same?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe low level way:\\n\\nfrom __future__ import with_statement\\nwith open(filename1) as f1:\\n   with open(filename2) as f2:\\n      if f1.read() == f2.read():\\n         ...\\n\\n\\nThe high level way:\\n\\nimport filecmp\\nif filecmp.cmp(filename1, filename2, shallow=False):\\n   ...\\n\\n',\n \"Question:\\nTiny python executable?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIf you recompile pythonxy.dll, you can omit modules that you don't need.

Development/deployment and maintenance for a multi-platform GUI is non-trivial.\\n\\nDeveloping good user-interfaces is hard, period.\\n\\nThe reality is that I\\'ve made my living over the last 10 years developing mostly web based applications, because they\\'re faster to develop, easier to deploy and provide enough utility that people will use them if they have to.\\n\\nI don\\'t believe that most users would use a web interface if given an alternative.\\n\\nIMNSHO\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow to implement Google Suggest in your own web application (e.g. using Python)\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou could try with\\n<a href=\"http://google.com/complete/search?output=toolbar&amp;q=keyword\">http://google.com/complete/search?output=toolbar&amp;q=keyword\\n\\nand then parse the xml result.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nWhich exception should I raise on bad/illegal argument combinations in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI would just raise <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ValueError\">ValueError, unless you need a more specific exception..\\n\\ndef import_to_orm(name, save=False, recurse=False):\\n    if recurse and not save:\\n        raise ValueError(\"save must be True if recurse is True\")\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s really no point in doing class BadValueError(ValueError):pass - your custom class is identical in use to <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ValueError\">ValueError, so why not use that?\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython packages and egg-info directories\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe .egg-info directories get only created if --single-version-externally-managed was used to install the egg. \"Normally\", installing an egg would create a single directory (or zip file), containing both the code and the metadata. \\n\\npkg_resources (which is the library that reads the metadata) has a function require which can be used to request a specific version of the package. For \"old-style\", regular imports, easy_install hacks a .pth file to get the egg directory onto sys.path. For --single-version-externally-managed, this hacking is not necessary, because there will only be a single version installed (by the system\\'s pacakging infrastructure, e.g. rpm or dpkg). The egg-info is still included, for applications that use require (or any of the other pkg_resources binding mechanisms).\\n\\nIf you want to install a package by hard-linking, I recommend to use \"setup.py develop\". This is a command from setuptools which doesn\\'t actually install the egg, but makes it available site-wide. To do so, it creates an egg-link file so that pkg_resources can find it, and it manipulates a .pth file, so that regular import can find it.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nMessage Box in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYour best bet is the tkMessageBox module, which should work on all systems (as Python will typically come with Tkinter).\\n\\nIf you can restrict yourself to a specific operating system, better choices might be available.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nDownload image file from the HTML page source using python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nHere is some code to download all the images from the supplied URL, and save them in the specified output folder.

WSGI is a Python-specific interface standard for web applications.\\n\\nThough they both have roots in CGI, they're rather different in scope and you could indeed quite reasonably use both at once, for example having a mod_scgi on the webserver talk to a WSGI app run as an SCGI server. There are multiple library implementations that will run WSGI applications as SCGI servers for you (eg. wsgitools, cherrypy).\\n\\nThey are both 'reliable', in as much as you can consider a specification reliable as opposed to a particular implementation. These days you would probably write your application as a WSGI callable, and consider the question of deployment separately.\\n\\nMaybe an Apache+mod_wsgi (embedded) interface might be a bit faster than an Apache+mod_scgi+(SCGI wrapper lib), but in all likelihood it's not going to be hugely different. More valuable is the ability to run the application on a variety of servers, platforms and connection standards.\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nHow can I make a fake \"active session\" for gconf?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI can reproduce this by installing GConf 2.24 on my machine. GConf 2.22 works fine, but 2.24 breaks it.\\n\\nGConf is failing to launch because D-Bus is not running. Manually spawning D-Bus and the GConf daemon makes this work again.\\n\\nI tried to spawn the D-Bus session bus by doing the following:\\n\\nimport dbus\\ndummy_bus = dbus.SessionBus()\\n\\n\\n...but got this:\\n\\ndbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ExecFailed: dbus-launch failed to autolaunch D-Bus session: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.\\n\\n\\nWeird. Looks like it doesn\\'t like to come up if X isn\\'t running. To work around that, start dbus-launch manually (IIRC use the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/os-process.html\">os.system() call):\\n\\n$ dbus-launch \\nDBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-eAmT3q94u0,guid=c250f62d3c4739dcc9a12d48490fc268\\nDBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID=15836\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to parse the output somehow and inject them into environment variables (you\\'ll probably want to use <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/os-procinfo.html\">os.putenv). For my testing, I just used the shell, and set the environment vars manually with export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=blahblah..., etc.\\n\\nNext, you need to launch gconftool-2 --spawn with those environment variables you received from dbus-launch. This will launch the GConf daemon. If the D-Bus environment vars are not set, the daemon will not launch.\\n\\nThen, run your GConf code. Provided you set the D-Bus session bus environment variables for your own script, you will now be able to communicate with the GConf daemon.\\n\\nI know it\\'s complicated.\\n\\ngconftool-2 provides a --direct option that enables you to set GConf variables without needing to communicate with the server, but I haven\\'t been able to find an equivalent option for the Python bindings (short of outputting XML manually).\\n\\nEdit: For future reference, if anybody wants to run dbus-launch from within a normal bash script (as opposed to a Python script, as this thread is discussing), it is quite easy to retrieve the session bus address for use within the script:\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\neval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`\\n\\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID\\n\\ndo_other_stuff_here\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nWhy are Exceptions iterable?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nNote that what is happening is not related to any kind of implicit string conversion etc, but because the Exception class implements __getitem__(), and uses it to return the values in the args tuple (ex.args).  You can see this by the fact that you get the whole string as your first and only item in the iteration, rather than the character-by-character result you\\'d get if you iterate over the string.\\n\\nThis surprised me too, but thinking about it, I\\'m guessing it is for backwards compatability reasons.  Python used to (<a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/essays/stdexceptions.html\">pre-1.5) lack the current class hierarchy of exceptions.  Instead, strings were thrown, with (usually) a tuple argument for any details that should be passed to the handling block.  ie:\\n\\ntry:\\n    raise \"something failed\", (42, \"some other details\")\\nexcept \"something failed\", args:\\n    errCode, msg = args\\n    print \"something failed.  error code %d: %s\" % (errCode, msg)\\n\\n\\nIt looks like this behavior was put in to avoid breaking pre-1.5 code expecting a tuple of arguments, rather than a non-iterable exception object.  There are a couple of examples of this with IOError in the Fatal Breakage section of the above <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/essays/stdexceptions.html\">link\\n\\nString exceptions have been depecated for a while, and are going away in Python 3.

Fine-grained locking allows greater parallelism - two threads can\\nexecute in parallel when they don\\'t share any resources.  However there is a much larger administrative overhead.  For\\nevery line of code, you may need to acquire and release several locks.\\n\\nThe coarse grained approach is the opposite.  Two threads can\\'t run at the same time, but an individual thread will run faster because its not doing so much bookkeeping.  Ultimately it comes down to a tradeoff between single-threaded speed and parallelism.\\n\\nThere have been a few attempts to remove the GIL in python, but the extra overhead for single threaded machines was generally too large.  Some cases can actually be slower even on multi-processor machines\\ndue to lock contention.  \\n\\n\\n  Do other languages that are compiled to bytecode employ a similar mechanism?\\n\\n\\nIt varies, and it probably shouldn\\'t be considered a language property so much as an implementation property.\\nFor instance, there are Python implementations such as Jython and IronPython which use the threading approach of their underlying VM, rather than a GIL approach.

But you do have to keep one or two things in mind when using the ORM and plain SQL in the same transaction. Basically, from one side, ORM data modifications will only hit the database when you flush the changes from your session. From the other side, SQL data manipulation statements don't affect the objects that are in your session.\\n\\nSo if you say\\n\\nfor c in session.query(Stuff).all():\\n    c.foo = c.foo+1\\nsession.commit()\\n\\n\\nit will do what it says, go fetch all the objects from the database, modify all the objects and then when it's time to flush the changes to the database, update the rows one by one.\\n\\nInstead you should do this:\\n\\nsession.execute(update(stuff_table, values={stuff_table.c.foo: stuff_table.c.foo + 1}))\\nsession.commit()\\n\\n\\nThis will execute as one query as you would expect, and because atleast the default session configuration expires all data in the session on commit you don't have any stale data issues.\\n\\nIn the almost-released 0.5 series you could also use this method for updating:\\n\\nsession.query(Stuff).update({Stuff.foo: Stuff.foo + 1})\\nsession.commit()\\n\\n\\nThat will basically run the same SQL statement as the previous snippet, but also select the changed rows and expire any stale data in the session. If you know you aren't using any session data after the update you could also add synchronize_session=False to the update statement and get rid of that select.\\n\",\n \"Question:\\nDjango - How to do tuple unpacking in a template 'for' loop\\n\\nAnswer:\\nit would be best if you construct your data like {note the '(' and ')' can be exchanged for '[' and ']' repectively, one being for tuples, one for lists}\\n\\n[ (Product_Type_1, ( product_1, product_2 )),\\n   (Product_Type_2, ( product_3, product_4 )) ]\\n\\n\\nand have the template do this:\\n\\n{% for product_type, products in product_type_list %}\\n    {{ product_type }}\\n    {% for product in products %}\\n        {{ product }}\\n    {% endfor %}\\n{% endfor %}\\n\\n\\nthe way tuples/lists are unpacked in for loops is based on the item returned by the list iterator.\\neach iteration only one item was returned. the first time around the loop, Product_Type_1, the second your list of products... \\n\",\n 'Question:\\nHow does one add default (hidden) values to form templates in Django?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe widget django.forms.widgets.HiddenInput will render your field as hidden.\\n\\nIn most cases, I think you\\'ll find that any hidden form value could also be specified as a url parameter instead.

Of course, Python is beating Perl to that particular finish line by releasing first. It should be noted, however, that Perl\\'s changes are much more extensive than Python\\'s and likely will be harder to detangle.\\n\\n(There\\'s a price for Perl\\'s \"There\\'s More Than One Way To Do It\" philosophy.)\\n\\nThere are examples like the changes from version to version of .NET-based languages (ironic, considering the whole point of .NET was supposed to be API stability and cross-platform compatibility). However, I would hardly call those languages \"mature\"; it\\'s always been more of a design-on-the-go, build-the-plane-as-we-fly approach to things.\\n\\nOr, as I tend to think of it, most languages come from either \"organic growth\" or  \"engineered construction.\" Perl is the perfect example of organic growth; it started as a fancy text processing tool ala awk/sed and grew into a full language.\\n\\nPython, on the other hand, is much more engineered. Spend a bit of time wandering around the extensive whitepapers on their website to see the extensive debate that goes into every even minor change to the language\\'s syntax and implementation.\\n\\nThe idea of making these sorts of far-reaching changes is somewhat new to programming languages because programming languages themselves have changed in nature. It used to be that programming methodologies changed only when a new processor came out that had a new instruction set. The early languages tended to either be so low-level and married to assembly language (e.g. C) or so utterly dynamic in nature (Forth, Lisp) that such a mid-stream change wouldn\\'t even come up as a consideration.\\n\\nAs to whether or not the changes are good ones, I\\'m not sure. I tend to have faith in the people guiding Python\\'s development, however; the changes in the language thus far have been largely for the better.\\n\\nI think in the days to come the Global Interpreter Lock will prove more central than syntax changes. Though the new multiprocessor library might alleviate most of that.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nIs there a cross-platform way of getting information from Python\\'s OSError?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThe errno attribute on the error should be the same on all platforms.

This does\\n    NOT remove normal HTML tags like &lt;p&gt;.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    htmlCodes = (\\n            (\"\\'\", \\'&amp;#39;\\'),\\n            (\\'\"\\', \\'&amp;quot;\\'),\\n            (\\'&gt;\\', \\'&amp;gt;\\'),\\n            (\\'&lt;\\', \\'&amp;lt;\\'),\\n            (\\'&amp;\\', \\'&amp;amp;\\')\\n        )\\n    for code in htmlCodes:\\n        s = s.replace(code[1], code[0])\\n    return s\\n\\nunescaped = html_decode(my_string)\\n\\n\\nThis, however, is not a general solution; it is only appropriate for strings encoded with django.utils.html.escape.  More generally, it is a good idea to stick with the standard library:\\n\\n# Python 2.x:\\nimport HTMLParser\\nhtml_parser = HTMLParser.HTMLParser()\\nunescaped = html_parser.unescape(my_string)\\n\\n# Python 3.x:\\nimport html.parser\\nhtml_parser = html.parser.HTMLParser()\\nunescaped = html_parser.unescape(my_string)\\n\\n\\nAs a suggestion: it may make more sense to store the HTML unescaped in your database.  It\\'d be worth looking into getting unescaped results back from BeautifulSoup if possible, and avoiding this process altogether.\\n\\nWith Django, escaping only occurs during template rendering; so to prevent escaping you just tell the templating engine not to escape your string.  To do that, use one of these options in your template:\\n\\n{{ context_var|safe }}\\n{% autoescape off %}\\n    {{ context_var }}\\n{% endautoescape %}\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nPython ctypes and function calls\\n\\nAnswer:\\nAs <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/275207/python-ctypes-and-function-calls#275333\">vincent mentioned, this is due to the allocated page being marked as non executable.  Newer processors support this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit\">functionality, and its used as an added layer of security by OS\\'s which support it.  The idea is to protect against certain buffer overflow attacks.  Eg. A common attack is to overflow a stack variable, rewriting the return address to point to code you have inserted.  With a non-executable stack this now only produces a segfault, rather than control of the process.  Similar attacks also exist for heap memory.\\n\\nTo get around it, you need to alter the protection.  This can only be performed on page aligned memory, so you\\'ll probably need to change your code to something like the below:\\n\\nlibc = CDLL(\\'libc.so\\')\\n\\n# Some constants\\nPROT_READ = 1\\nPROT_WRITE = 2\\nPROT_EXEC = 4\\n\\ndef executable_code(buffer):\\n    \"\"\"Return a pointer to a page-aligned executable buffer filled in with the data of the string provided.\\n    The pointer should be freed with libc.free() when finished\"\"\"\\n\\n    buf = c_char_p(buffer)\\n    size = len(buffer)\\n    # Need to align to a page boundary, so use valloc\\n    addr = libc.valloc(size)\\n    addr = c_void_p(addr)\\n\\n    if 0 == addr:  \\n        raise Exception(\"Failed to allocate memory\")\\n\\n    memmove(addr, buf, size)\\n    if 0 != libc.mprotect(addr, len(buffer), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC):\\n        raise Exception(\"Failed to set protection on buffer\")\\n    return addr\\n\\ncode_ptr = executable_code(buffer)\\nfptr = cast(code_ptr, CFUNCTYPE(c_long, c_long))\\nprint fptr(1234)\\nlibc.free(code_ptr)\\n\\n\\nNote: It may be a good idea to unset the executable flag before freeing the page.  Most C libraries don\\'t actually return the memory to the OS when done, but keep it in their own pool.  This could mean they will reuse the page elsewhere without clearing the EXEC bit, bypassing the security benefit. \\n\\nAlso note that this is fairly non-portable.  I\\'ve tested it on linux, but not on any other OS.  It won\\'t work on windows, buy may do on other unixes (BSD, OsX?).\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow do you get a thumbnail of a movie using IMDbPy?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nNote:\\n\\n\\nNot every movie has a cover url.

Let it connect two processes with a pipeline.\\n\\nYou\\'d be a lot happier rewriting \\'script.awk\\' into Python, eliminating awk and the pipeline.\\n\\nEdit.  Some of the reasons for suggesting that awk isn\\'t helping.\\n\\n[There are too many reasons to respond via comments.]\\n\\n\\nAwk is adding a step of no significant value.  There\\'s nothing unique about awk\\'s processing that Python doesn\\'t handle.\\nThe pipelining from awk to sort, for large sets of data, may improve elapsed processing time.  For short sets of data, it has no significant benefit.  A quick measurement of awk &gt;file ; sort file and awk | sort will reveal of concurrency helps.  With sort, it rarely helps because sort is not a once-through filter.\\nThe simplicity of \"Python to sort\" processing (instead of \"Python to awk to sort\") prevents the exact kind of questions being asked here.\\nPython -- while wordier than awk -- is also explicit where awk has certain implicit rules that are opaque to newbies, and confusing to non-specialists.\\nAwk (like the shell script itself) adds Yet Another Programming language.  If all of this can be done in one language (Python), eliminating the shell and the awk programming eliminates two programming languages, allowing someone to focus on the value-producing parts of the task.\\n\\n\\nBottom line: awk can\\'t add significant value.  In this case, awk is a net cost; it added enough complexity that it was necessary to ask this question.  Removing awk will be a net gain.\\n\\nSidebar Why building a pipeline (a | b) is so hard.\\n\\nWhen the shell is confronted with a | b it has to do the following.\\n\\n\\nFork a child process of the original shell.  This will eventually become b.\\nBuild an os pipe.  (not a Python subprocess.PIPE) but call os.pipe() which returns two new file descriptors that are connected via  common buffer.  At this point the process has stdin, stdout, stderr from its parent, plus a file that will be \"a\\'s stdout\" and \"b\\'s stdin\".  \\nFork a child.  The child replaces its stdout with the new a\\'s stdout.  Exec the a process.\\nThe b child closes replaces its stdin with the new b\\'s stdin.  Exec the b process.\\nThe b child waits for a to complete.  \\nThe parent is waiting for b to complete.\\n\\n\\nI think that the above can be used recursively to spawn a | b | c, but you have to implicitly parenthesize long pipelines, treating them as if they\\'re a | (b | c).\\n\\nSince Python has os.pipe(), os.exec() and os.fork(), and you can replace sys.stdin and sys.stdout, there\\'s a way to do the above in pure Python.  Indeed, you may be able to work out some shortcuts using os.pipe() and subprocess.Popen.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s easier to delegate that operation to the shell.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nWhat is a partial class?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nA <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488.aspx\">partial type (it doesn\\'t have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files.\\n\\nThe main use for this is to allow a code generator (e.g. a Visual Studio designer) to \"own\" one file, while hand-written code is put in another.\\n\\nI\\'ve no idea whether Python/Perl have the same capabilities, I\\'m afraid.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nDoes python optimize modules when they are imported multiple times?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nPython modules could be considered as singletons... no matter how many times you import them they get initialized only once, so it\\'s better to do:\\n\\nimport MyLib\\nimport ReallyBigLib\\n\\n\\nRelevant documentation on the import statement:\\n\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement\">https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement\\n\\n\\n  Once the name of the module is known (unless otherwise specified, the term √¢\\x80\\x9cmodule√¢\\x80\\x9d will refer to both packages and modules), searching for the module or package can begin.

Even though it has features for integrating other apps, it doesn\\'t have the extensibility/integration of FeinCMS or the simplicity of django-page-cms. That being said, I think the consensus is that this is the best Open Source CMS for Django. However, it\\'s docs are a little lacking. update: I have been told that integrating apps into DjangoCMS 2.1 has been improved.\\n\\nFeinCMS - Is a great set of tools for combining and building CMS functionality into your own apps. It\\'s not \"out of the box\" at all, which means that you can integrate it however you want. It doesn\\'t want to take over your urls.py or control how you route pages. It\\'s probably a prototype for the next-generation of truly pluggable apps in Django. - We are moving from django-page-cms to FeinCMS because our primary models is high volume eCommerce and I have custom content-types I want to integrate that aren\\'t blogs or flash. Good documentation and support as well.\\n\\nDjango-page-cms - Is great if you want to just have some \"About Us\" pages around your principle application. Its menu system is not truly hierarchical and building your page presentation is up to you. But it\\'s very simple, unobtrusive, and very easy to slap into your app and get a navigation going that clients can manage, or even for yourself. It has no docs that I know of, but you won\\'t really need any. Read the code and you will get it all in 30 minutes or less.\\n\\nupdate\\n\\nMezzanine - Is a very well designed CMS and one that I have finally settled on for most of my client work, mostly because it has an integrated eCommerce portion. But beyond that it has very extensible page models, and a custom admin interface that a client might be willing to use. It also has the best \"out of the box\" experience i.e. You can have a full fledged site up with one command.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow do I remove/delete a folder that is not empty with Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nimport shutil\\n\\nshutil.rmtree(\\'/folder_name\\')\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree\">Standard Library Reference: shutil.rmtree.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nEmacs 23 and iPython\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI got it working quite well with emacs 23.

This will give misleading log statements in cases of inheritance, but will tell you the class of the object whose method is being called.  For example:\\n\\nfrom functools import wraps  # use this to preserve function signatures and docstrings\\ndef logger(func):\\n    @wraps(func)\\n    def with_logging(*args, **kwargs):\\n        print \"Entering %s.%s\" % (args[0].__class__.__name__, func.__name__)\\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\\n    return with_logging\\n\\nclass C(object):\\n    @logger\\n    def f(self):\\n        pass\\n\\nC().f()\\n\\n\\nAs I said, this won\\'t work properly in cases where you\\'ve inherited a function from a parent class; in this case you might say\\n\\nclass B(C):\\n    pass\\n\\nb = B()\\nb.f()\\n\\n\\nand get the message Entering B.f where you actually want to get the message Entering C.f since that\\'s the correct class.  On the other hand, this might be acceptable, in which case I\\'d recommend this approach over Claudiu\\'s suggestion.\\n',\n 'Question:\\n\"is\" operator behaves unexpectedly with integers\\n\\nAnswer:\\nTake a look at this:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 256\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 256\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a)\\n9987148\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(b)\\n9987148\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 257\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 257\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a)\\n11662816\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(b)\\n11662828\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Here\\'s what I found in the Python 2 documentation, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/int.html\">\"Plain Integer Objects\" (It\\'s the same for <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html\">Python 3):\\n\\n\\n  The current implementation keeps an\\n  array of integer objects for all\\n  integers between -5 and 256, when you\\n  create an int in that range you\\n  actually just get back a reference to\\n  the existing object.

In other words, if you have a decorator\\n\\ndef logged(func):\\n    def with_logging(*args, **kwargs):\\n        print func.__name__ + \" was called\"\\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\\n    return with_logging\\n\\n\\nthen when you say\\n\\n@logged\\ndef f(x):\\n   \"\"\"does some math\"\"\"\\n   return x + x * x\\n\\n\\nit\\'s exactly the same as saying\\n\\ndef f(x):\\n    \"\"\"does some math\"\"\"\\n    return x + x * x\\nf = logged(f)\\n\\n\\nand your function f is replaced with the function with_logging.  Unfortunately, this means that if you then say\\n\\nprint f.__name__\\n\\n\\nit will print with_logging because that\\'s the name of your new function.  In fact, if you look at the docstring for f, it will be blank because with_logging has no docstring, and so the docstring you wrote won\\'t be there anymore.  Also, if you look at the pydoc result for that function, it won\\'t be listed as taking one argument x; instead it\\'ll be listed as taking *args and **kwargs because that\\'s what with_logging takes.\\n\\nIf using a decorator always meant losing this information about a function, it would be a serious problem.  That\\'s why we have functools.wraps.

Therefore, when you manipulate them, you manipulate objects, not strings, not timestamps nor anything.\\n\\nAny object in Python have TWO string representations:\\n\\n\\nThe regular representation that is used by \"print\", can be get using the str() function. It is most of the time the most common human readable format and is used to ease display. So str(datetime.datetime(2008, 11, 22, 19, 53, 42)) gives you \\'2008-11-22 19:53:42\\'. \\nThe alternative representation that is used to represent the object nature (as a data). It can be get using the repr() function and is handy to know what kind of data your manipulating while you are developing or debugging. repr(datetime.datetime(2008, 11, 22, 19, 53, 42)) gives you \\'datetime.datetime(2008, 11, 22, 19, 53, 42)\\'.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened is that when you have printed the date using \"print\", it used str() so you could see a nice date string. But when you have printed mylist, you have printed a list of objects and Python tried to represent the set of data, using repr().\\n\\nThe How: what do you want to do with that?\\n\\nWell, when you manipulate dates, keep using the date objects all long the way. They got thousand of useful methods and most of the Python API expect dates to be objects.\\n\\nWhen you want to display them, just use str(). In Python, the good practice is to explicitly cast everything. So just when it\\'s time to print, get a string representation of your date using str(date).\\n\\nOne last thing. When you tried to print the dates, you printed mylist. If you want to print a date, you must print the date objects, not their container (the list).\\n\\nE.G, you want to print all the date in a list :\\n\\nfor date in mylist :\\n    print str(date)\\n\\n\\nNote that in that specific case, you can even omit str() because print will use it for you. But it should not become a habit :-)\\n\\nPractical case, using your code\\n\\nimport datetime\\nmylist = []\\ntoday = datetime.date.today()\\nmylist.append(today)\\nprint mylist[0] # print the date object, not the container ;-)\\n2008-11-22\\n\\n# It\\'s better to always use str() because :\\n\\nprint \"This is a new day : \", mylist[0] # will work\\nThis is a new day : 2008-11-22\\n\\nprint \"This is a new day : \" + mylist[0] # will crash\\ncannot concatenate \\'str\\' and \\'datetime.date\\' objects\\n\\nprint \"This is a new day : \" + str(mylist[0]) \\nThis is a new day : 2008-11-22\\n\\n\\nAdvanced date formatting\\n\\nDates have a default representation, but you may want to print them in a specific format. In that case, you can get a custom string representation using the strftime() method.\\n\\nstrftime() expects a string pattern explaining how you want to format your date.\\n\\nE.G : \\n\\nprint today.strftime(\\'We are the %d, %b %Y\\')\\n\\'We are the 22, Nov 2008\\'\\n\\n\\nAll the letter after a \"%\" represent a format for something :\\n\\n\\n%d is the day number\\n%m is the month number\\n%b is the month abbreviation\\n%y is the year last two digits\\n%Y is the all year\\n\\n\\netc\\n\\n<a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior\">Have a look at the official documentation, or <a href=\"http://strftime.org\">McCutchen\\'s quick reference you can\\'t know them all.\\n\\nSince <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/\">PEP3101, every object can have its own format used automatically by the method format of any string. In the case of the datetime, the format is the same used in\\nstrftime. So you can do the same as above like this:\\n\\nprint \"We are the {:%d, %b %Y}\".format(today)\\n\\'We are the 22, Nov 2008\\'\\n\\n\\nThe advantage of this form is that you can also convert other objects at the same time.\\n\\nLocalization\\n\\nDates can automatically adapt to the local language and culture if you use them the right way, but it\\'s a bit complicated.

Think of the following cases:\\n\\n\\nthe thread is holding a critical resource that must be closed properly\\nthe thread has created several other threads that must be killed as well.\\n\\n\\nThe nice way of handling this if you can afford it (if you are managing your own threads) is to have an exit_request flag that each threads checks on regular interval to see if it is time for him to exit.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nimport threading\\n\\nclass StoppableThread(threading.Thread):\\n    \"\"\"Thread class with a stop() method. The thread itself has to check\\n    regularly for the stopped() condition.\"\"\"\\n\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        super(StoppableThread, self).__init__()\\n        self._stop = threading.Event()\\n\\n    def stop(self):\\n        self._stop.set()\\n\\n    def stopped(self):\\n        return self._stop.isSet()\\n\\n\\nIn this code, you should call stop() on the thread when you want it to exit, and wait for the thread to exit properly using join(). The thread should check the stop flag at regular intervals.\\n\\nThere are cases however when you really need to kill a thread. An example is when you are wrapping an external library that is busy for long calls and you want to interrupt it.\\n\\nThe following code allows (with some restrictions) to raise an Exception in a Python thread:\\n\\ndef _async_raise(tid, exctype):\\n    \\'\\'\\'Raises an exception in the threads with id tid\\'\\'\\'\\n    if not inspect.isclass(exctype):\\n        raise TypeError(\"Only types can be raised (not instances)\")\\n    res = ctypes.pythonapi.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc(tid,\\n                                                  ctypes.py_object(exctype))\\n    if res == 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\"invalid thread id\")\\n    elif res != 1:\\n        # \"if it returns a number greater than one, you\\'re in trouble,\\n        # and you should call it again with exc=NULL to revert the effect\"\\n        ctypes.pythonapi.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc(tid, 0)\\n        raise SystemError(\"PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc failed\")\\n\\nclass ThreadWithExc(threading.Thread):\\n    \\'\\'\\'A thread class that supports raising exception in the thread from\\n       another thread.\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n    def _get_my_tid(self):\\n        \"\"\"determines this (self\\'s) thread id\\n\\n        CAREFUL : this function is executed in the context of the caller\\n        thread, to get the identity of the thread represented by this\\n        instance.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        if not self.isAlive():\\n            raise threading.ThreadError(\"the thread is not active\")\\n\\n        # do we have it cached?\\n        if hasattr(self, \"_thread_id\"):\\n            return self._thread_id\\n\\n        # no, look for it in the _active dict\\n        for tid, tobj in threading._active.items():\\n            if tobj is self:\\n                self._thread_id = tid\\n                return tid\\n\\n        # TODO: in python 2.6, there\\'s a simpler way to do : self.ident\\n\\n        raise AssertionError(\"could not determine the thread\\'s id\")\\n\\n    def raiseExc(self, exctype):\\n        \"\"\"Raises the given exception type in the context of this thread.\\n\\n        If the thread is busy in a system call (time.sleep(),\\n        socket.accept(), ...), the exception is simply ignored.\\n\\n        If you are sure that your exception should terminate the thread,\\n        one way to ensure that it works is:\\n\\n            t = ThreadWithExc( ... )\\n            ...\\n            t.raiseExc( SomeException )\\n            while t.isAlive():\\n                time.sleep( 0.1 )\\n                t.raiseExc( SomeException )\\n\\n        If the exception is to be caught by the thread, you need a way to\\n        check that your thread has caught it.\\n\\n        CAREFUL : this function is executed in the context of the\\n        caller thread, to raise an excpetion in the context of the\\n        thread represented by this instance.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        _async_raise( self._get_my_tid(), exctype )\\n\\n\\nAs noted in the documentation, this is not a magic bullet because if the thread is busy outside the Python interpreter, it will not catch the interruption.\\n\\nA good usage pattern of this code is to have the thread catch a specific exception and perform the cleanup.

I would second the use of the (c)ElementTree library.

(I was sort of irked into making this because the top-voted answers were not helpful, as the table shows.)\\n\\n\\'Pair array\\' is the scheme below in my original answer (\"I\\'d start with the array with keys\\nbeing the first two words...\"), where the value table for each pair is\\nrepresented as a single string. \\'Squeezed pair array\\' is the same,\\nleaving out the frequency values that are equal to 1 (the most common\\ncase). \\'Squeezed single array\\' is like squeezed pair array, but gloms key and value together as one string (with a separator character).

This saves space on pointers, etc. It still wastes space due to the repetition of words; there\\'s a standard trick to strip out common prefixes, with another level of index to get them back, but that\\'s rather more complex and slower. (The idea is to store successive chunks of the array in a compressed form that must be scanned sequentially, along with a random-access index to each chunk. Chunks are big enough to compress, but small enough for reasonable access time. The particular compression scheme applicable here: if successive entries are \\'hello george\\' and \\'hello world\\', make the second entry be \\'6world\\' instead. (6 being the length of the prefix in common.) Or maybe you could get away with using <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-zlib.html\">zlib? Anyway, you can find out more in this vein by looking up dictionary structures used in full-text search.) So specifically, I\\'d start with the array with keys being the first two words, with a parallel array whose entries list the possible third words and their frequencies. It might still suck, though -- I think you may be out of luck as far as batteries-included memory-efficient options.\\n\\nAlso, binary tree structures are not recommended for memory efficiency here. E.g., <a href=\"http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc148h/fall/assignment3/bursttries.pdf\">this paper tests a variety of data structures on a similar problem (unigrams instead of trigrams though) and finds a hashtable to beat all of the tree structures by that measure.\\n\\nI should have mentioned, as someone else did, that the sorted array could be used just for the wordlist, not bigrams or trigrams; then for your \\'real\\' data structure, whatever it is, you use integer keys instead of strings -- indices into the wordlist. (But this keeps you from exploiting common prefixes except in the wordlist itself. Maybe I shouldn\\'t suggest this after all.)\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow are Python\\'s Built In Dictionaries Implemented\\n\\nAnswer:\\nHere is everything about Python dicts that I was able to put together (probably more than anyone would like to know; but the answer is comprehensive). \\n\\n\\nPython dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.\\nHash tables must allow for hash collisions i.e. even if two distinct keys have the same hash value, the table\\'s implementation must have a strategy to insert and retrieve the key and value pairs unambiguously.\\nPython dict uses open addressing to resolve hash collisions (explained below) (see <a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Objects/dictobject.c#l296\">dictobject.c:296-297).\\nPython hash table is just a contiguous block of memory (sort of like an array, so you can do an O(1) lookup by index). \\nEach slot in the table can store one and only one entry. This is important.\\nEach entry in the table actually a combination of the three values: &lt; hash, key, value >. This is implemented as a C struct (see <a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Include/dictobject.h#l51\">dictobject.h:51-56).\\nThe figure below is a logical representation of a Python hash table. In the figure below, 0, 1, ..., i, ... on the left are indices of the slots in the hash table (they are just for illustrative purposes and are not stored along with the table obviously!).\\n\\n# Logical model of Python Hash table\\n-+-----------------+\\n0| &lt;hash|key|value&gt;|\\n-+-----------------+\\n1|      ...        |\\n-+-----------------+\\n.|      ...        |\\n-+-----------------+\\ni|      ...        |\\n-+-----------------+\\n.|      ...        |\\n-+-----------------+\\nn|      ...        |\\n-+-----------------+\\n\\nWhen a new dict is initialized it starts with 8 slots. (see <a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Include/dictobject.h#l49\">dictobject.h:49)\\nWhen adding entries to the table, we start with some slot, i, that is based on the hash of the key. CPython initially uses i = hash(key) &amp; mask (where mask = PyDictMINSIZE - 1, but that\\'s not really important). Just note that the initial slot, i, that is checked depends on the hash of the key.\\nIf that slot is empty, the entry is added to the slot (by entry, I mean, &lt;hash|key|value&gt;). But what if that slot is occupied!? Most likely because another entry has the same hash (hash collision!)\\nIf the slot is occupied, CPython (and even PyPy) compares the the hash AND the key (by compare I mean == comparison not the is comparison)  of the entry in the slot against the key of the current entry to be inserted (<a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Objects/dictobject.c#l337\">dictobject.c:337,344-345). If both match, then it thinks the entry already exists, gives up and moves on to the next entry to be inserted. If either hash or the key don\\'t match, it starts probing. \\nProbing just means it searches the slots by slot to find an empty slot. Technically we could just go one by one, i+1, i+2, ... and use the first available one (that\\'s linear probing). But for reasons explained beautifully in the comments (see <a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Objects/dictobject.c#l33\">dictobject.c:33-126), CPython uses random probing. In random probing, the next slot is picked in a pseudo random order. The entry is added to the first empty slot. For this discussion, the actual algorithm used to pick the next slot is not really important (see <a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Objects/dictobject.c#l33\">dictobject.c:33-126 for the algorithm for probing). What is important is that the slots are probed until first empty slot is found.\\nThe same thing happens for lookups, just starts with the initial slot i (where i depends on the hash of the key). If the hash and the key both don\\'t match the entry in the slot, it starts probing, until it finds a slot with a match. If all slots are exhausted, it reports a fail.\\nBTW, the dict will be resized if it is two-thirds full. This avoids slowing down lookups. (see <a href=\"http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/52f68c95e025/Include/dictobject.h#l64\">dictobject.h:64-65)\\n\\n\\nNOTE: I did the research on Python Dict implementation in response to my own <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9010222/\">question about how multiple entries in a dict can have same hash values.

[Revised]\\n\\nIt appears you have something that works.  Leverage to learn your framework, learn the tools, and learn what knobs you can turn without breaking a sweat.  Specifically, using session state.\\n\\nSecond, fiddle with caching, session management, and things that are easy to adjust, and see if you have enough speed.  Find out whether MySQL socket or named pipe is faster by trying them out.  These are the no-programming optimizations.\\n\\nThird, measure performance to find your actual bottleneck.  Be prepared to provide (and defend) the measurements as fine-grained enough to be useful and stable enough to providing meaningful comparison of alternatives.  \\n\\nFor example, show the performance difference between persistent sessions and cached sessions.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow to quickly parse a list of strings\\n\\nAnswer:\\nimport csv\\n\\ninput = [\\'abc,\"a string, with a comma\",\"another, one\"\\']\\nparser = csv.reader(input)\\n\\nfor fields in parser:\\n  for i,f in enumerate(fields):\\n    print i,f    # in Python 3 and up, print is a function; use: print(i,f)\\n\\n\\nResult:\\n\\n\\n0 abc\\n1 a string, with a comma\\n2 another, one\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nConverting a PDF to a series of images with Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nImageMagick has <a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/download/python/\">Python bindings.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nDifference between class foo and class foo(object) in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nPrior to python 2.2 there were essentially two different types of class: Those defined by C extensions and C coded builtins (types) and those defined by python class statements (classes).  This led to problems when you wanted to mix python-types and builtin types.  The most common reason for this is subclassing.  If you wanted to subclass the list type in python code, you were out of luck, and so various workarounds were used instead, such as subclassing the pure python implementation of lists (in the UserList module) instead.\\n\\nThis was a fairly ugly, so in 2.2 there was a <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0252/\">move to unify python and builtin types, including the ability to <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0253/\">inherit from them. The result is \"new style classes\".  These do have some incompatible differences to old-style classes however, so for backward compatability the bare class syntax creates an old-style class, while the new behaviour is obtained by inheriting from object.  The most visible behaviour differences are:\\n\\n\\nThe method resolution order (MRO).  There is a difference in behaviour in diamond-shaped inheritance hierarchies (where A inherits from both B and C, which both inherit from a common base class D.  Previously, methods were looked up left-to right, depth first (ie A B D C D)  However if C overloads a member of D, it won\\'t be used by A (as it finds D\\'s implementation first) This is bad for various styles of programming (eg. using mixin classes).  New style classes will treat this situation as A B C D, (look at the __mro__ attribute of a class to see the order it will search)\\nThe __new__ constructor is added, which allows the class to act as a factory method, rather than return a new instance of the class.  Useful for returning particular subclasses, or reusing immutable objects rather than creating new ones without having to change the creation interface.\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#implementing-descriptors\">Descriptors.  These are the feature behind such things as properties, classmethods, staticmethods etc.  Essentially, they provide a way to control what happens when you access or set a particular attribute on a (new style) class.\\n\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow do you change the size of figures drawn with matplotlib?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n<a href=\"http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure\">figure tells you the call signature:\\n\\nfigure(num=None, figsize=(8, 6), dpi=80, facecolor=\\'w\\', edgecolor=\\'k\\')\\n\\n\\nSo figure(figsize=(1,1)) creates an inch-by-inch image, which will be 80-by-80 pixels unless you also give a different dpi argument.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nstring.split(text) or text.split() what\\'s the difference?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nInterestingly, the docstrings for the two are not completely the same in Python 2.5.1:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import string\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; help(string.split)\\nHelp on function split in module string:\\n\\nsplit(s, sep=None, maxsplit=-1)\\n    split(s [,sep [,maxsplit]]) -&gt; list of strings\\n\\n    Return a list of the words in the string s, using sep as the\\n    delimiter string.

That is, you have to check your logger for existing handlers before adding additional handlers to it.  This is a bit ugly because it\\'s perfectly reasonable to have multiple handlers -- even of the same type -- attached to one logger.  There are a few solutions to dealing with this.  One is check the handlers property of your logger object.  If you only want one handler and your length > 0, then don\\'t add it.

Is the complexity justified if you just want a blog? No. Is the complexity justified if you're building a company intranet for 400+ people? Yes. Is it a good investment if you're looking to be a consultant? Absolutely! There's a lot of Plone work out there, and it pays much better than the average PHP job.\\n\\nI'd encourage you to clarify what you're trying to build, and ask the Plone forums for advice. Plone has a very mature and friendly community √¢\\x80\\x94 and will absolutely let you know if what you're trying to do is a poor fit for Plone. You can of course do whatever you want with Plone, but there are some areas where it's the best solution available, other areas where it'll be a lot of work to change it to do something else.\\n\\nSome background:\\n\\nThe reason for the complexity of Plone at this point in time is that it's moving to a more modern architecture. It's bridging both the old and the new approach right now, which adds some complexity until the transition is mostly complete.\\n\\nPlone is doing this to avoid leaving their customers behind by breaking backwards compatibility, which they take very seriously √¢\\x80\\x94 unlike other systems I could mention (but won't ;). \\n\\nYou care about your data, the Plone community cares about their data √¢\\x80\\x94 and we'd like you to be able to upgrade to the new and better versions even when we're transitioning to a new architecture. This is one of the Plone community's strengths, but there is of course a penalty to pay for modifying the plane while it's flying, and that's a bit of temporary, extra complexity.\\n\\nFurthermore, Plone as a community has a strong focus on security (compare it to any other system on the vulnerabilities reported), and a very professional culture that values good architecture, testing and reusability.\\n\\nAs an example, consider the current version of Plone being developed (what will become 4.0):\\n\\n\\nIt starts up 3-4 times faster than the current version.\\nIt uses about 20% less memory than the current version.\\nThere's a much, much easier types system in the works (Dexterity), which will reduce the complexity and speed up the system a lot, while keeping the same level of functionality\\nThe code base is already 20% smaller than the current shipping version, and getting even smaller.\\nEarly benchmarks of the new types system show a 5&times; speedup for content editing, and we haven't really started optimizing this part yet.\\n\\n\\n√¢\\x80\\x94 Alexander Limi, Plone co-founder (and slightly biased ;)\\n\",\n \"Question:\\nCreating a list of objects in Python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding.\\n\\nYou never created an instance of SimpleClass at all, because you didn't call it.\\n\\nfor count in xrange(4):\\n    x = SimpleClass()\\n    x.attr = count\\n    simplelist.append(x)\\n\\n\\nOr, if you let the class take parameters, instead, you can use a list comprehension.\\n\\nsimplelist = [SimpleClass(count) for count in xrange(4)]\\n\\n\",\n 'Question:\\nReceive and send emails in python\\n\\nAnswer:\\nHere is a very simple example:\\n\\nimport smtplib\\n\\nserver = \\'mail.server.com\\'\\nuser = \\'\\'\\npassword = \\'\\'\\n\\nrecipients = [\\'user@mail.com\\', \\'other@mail.com\\']\\nsender = \\'you@mail.com\\'\\nmessage = \\'Hello World\\'\\n\\nsession = smtplib.SMTP(server)\\n# if your SMTP server doesn\\'t need authentications,\\n# you don\\'t need the following line:\\nsession.login(user, password)\\nsession.sendmail(sender, recipients, message)\\n\\n\\nFor more options, error handling, etc, look at the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-smtplib.html\">smtplib module documentation.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow can I download all emails with attachments from Gmail?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nHard one :-)\\n\\nimport email, getpass, imaplib, os\\n\\ndetach_dir = \\'.\\' # directory where to save attachments (default: current)\\nuser = raw_input(\"Enter your GMail username:\")\\npwd = getpass.getpass(\"Enter your password: \")\\n\\n# connecting to the gmail imap server\\nm = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(\"imap.gmail.com\")\\nm.login(user,pwd)\\nm.select(\"[Gmail]/All Mail\") # here you a can choose a mail box like INBOX instead\\n# use m.list() to get all the mailboxes\\n\\nresp, items = m.search(None, \"ALL\") # you could filter using the IMAP rules here (check http://www.example-code.com/csharp/imap-search-critera.asp)\\nitems = items[0].split() # getting the mails id\\n\\nfor emailid in items:\\n    resp, data = m.fetch(emailid, \"(RFC822)\") # fetching the mail, \"`(RFC822)`\" means \"get the whole stuff\", but you can ask for headers only, etc\\n    email_body = data[0][1] # getting the mail content\\n    mail = email.message_from_string(email_body) # parsing the mail content to get a mail object\\n\\n    #Check if any attachments at all\\n    if mail.get_content_maintype() != \\'multipart\\':\\n        continue\\n\\n    print \"[\"+mail[\"From\"]+\"] :\" + mail[\"Subject\"]\\n\\n    # we use walk to create a generator so we can iterate on the parts and forget about the recursive headach\\n    for part in mail.walk():\\n        # multipart are just containers, so we skip them\\n        if part.get_content_maintype() == \\'multipart\\':\\n            continue\\n\\n        # is this part an attachment ?\\n        if part.get(\\'Content-Disposition\\') is None:\\n            continue\\n\\n        filename = part.get_filename()\\n        counter = 1\\n\\n        # if there is no filename, we create one with a counter to avoid duplicates\\n        if not filename:\\n            filename = \\'part-%03d%s\\' % (counter, \\'bin\\')\\n            counter += 1\\n\\n        att_path = os.path.join(detach_dir, filename)\\n\\n        #Check if its already there\\n        if not os.path.isfile(att_path) :\\n            # finally write the stuff\\n            fp = open(att_path, \\'wb\\')\\n            fp.write(part.get_payload(decode=True))\\n            fp.close()\\n\\n\\nWowww!

Therefore, unfortunately, it\\'s not possible to go directly to the child model instance without additional queries.\\n\\nThis <a href=\"http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1031/\" rel=\"nofollow\">snippet shows a common method of adding a ContentType field to the base model:\\n\\nfrom django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType\\n\\nclass Base(models.Model):\\n    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType,editable=False,null=True)\\n\\n    def save(self):\\n        if(not self.content_type):\\n            self.content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(self.__class__)\\n        self.save_base()\\n\\n    def as_leaf_class(self):\\n        content_type = self.content_type\\n        model = content_type.model_class()\\n        if(model == Base):\\n            return self\\n        return model.objects.get(id=self.id)\\n\\n\\nYou can then say if Base.content_type.model_class() to determine the type.\\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1034/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is another snippet that adds a custom manager into the mix.\\n\\nAs you can see, both of these solutions have the potential to be extremely expensive.  If you have a large number of instances, using the as_leaf_class() method will require one query on each item.\\n\\nInstead, if you have a known set of child models, simply query each model separately and aggregate the instances into one list.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow do I pass a python list in the post query?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThere\\'s no such thing as a \"list of strings\" in a URL (or in practically anything in HTTP - if you specify multiple values for the same header, they come out as a single delimited value in most web app frameworks IME).

The core intuition is that we can create a set of equal-sized bins for the weighted list that can be indexed very efficiently through bit operations, to avoid a binary search.  It will turn out that, done correctly, we will need to only store two items from the original list per bin, and thus can represent the split with a single percentage.\\n\\nLet\\'s us take the example of five equally weighted choices, (a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1, e:1)\\n\\nTo create the alias lookup:\\n\\n\\nNormalize the weights such that they sum to 1.0.  (a:0.2 b:0.2 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)  This is the probability of choosing each weight.\\nFind the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the number of variables, and create this number of partitions, |p|.  Each partition represents a probability mass of 1/|p|.  In this case, we create 8 partitions, each able to contain 0.125.\\nTake the variable with the least remaining weight, and place as much of it\\'s mass as possible in an empty partition.  In this example, we see that a fills the first partition.  (p1{a|null,1.0},p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8) with (a:0.075, b:0.2 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2)\\nIf the partition is not filled, take the variable with the most weight, and fill the partition with that variable.  \\n\\n\\nRepeat steps 3 and 4, until none of the weight from the original partition need be assigned to the list.\\n\\nFor example, if we run another iteration of 3 and 4, we see \\n\\n(p1{a|null,1.0},p2{a|b,0.6},p3,p4,p5,p6,p7,p8) with (a:0, b:0.15 c:0.2 d:0.2 e:0.2) left to be assigned\\n\\nAt runtime:\\n\\n\\nGet a U(0,1) random number, say binary 0.001100000\\nbitshift it lg2(p), finding the index partition.  Thus, we shift it by 3, yielding 001.1, or position 1, and thus partition 2.\\nIf the partition is split, use the decimal portion of the shifted random number to decide the split. In this case, the value is 0.5, and 0.5 &lt; 0.6, so return a.\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"http://prxq.wordpress.com/2006/04/17/the-alias-method/\">Here is some code and another explanation, but unfortunately it doesn\\'t use the bitshifting technique, nor have I actually verified it.\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow to add file extensions based on file type on Linux/Unix?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYou can use\\n\\nfile -i filename\\n\\n\\nto get a MIME-type.

This is what the django developers used to allow django\\'s built-in <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/#ref-contrib-comments-index\">comment framework to attach a comment to any model in your project.\\n\\nFor instance, if you have some content object that you want to \"attach\" to other content objects of different types, like allowing each user to leave a \"favorite\" star on a blog post, image, or user profile, you can create a Favorite model with a <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#generic-relations\">generic relation field like so:\\n\\nfrom django.db import models\\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\\nfrom django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType\\nfrom django.contrib.contenttypes import generic\\n\\nclass Favorite(models.Model):\\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\\n    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)\\n    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()\\n    content_object = generic.GenericForeignKey(\\'content_type\\', \\'object_id\\')\\n\\n\\nIn this way you can add a Favorite star from any user to any model in your project.  If you want to add API access via the recipient model class you can either add a <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#reverse-generic-relations\">reverse generic relation field on the recipient model (although this would be \"coupling\" the two models, which you said you wanted to avoid), or do the lookup through the Favorite model with the content_type and object_id of the recipient instance, see the <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#reverse-generic-relations\">official docs for an example. \\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow do I check if a string is a number (float) in Python?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIn case you are looking for parsing (positive, unsigned) integers instead of floats, you can use the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit\">isdigit() function for string objects.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = \"03523\"\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.isdigit()\\nTrue\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = \"963spam\"\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b.isdigit()\\nFalse\\n\\n\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods\">String Methods - isdigit()\\n\\nThere\\'s also something on Unicode strings, which I\\'m not too familiar with\\n<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#unicode.isnumeric\">Unicode - Is decimal/decimal\\n',\n 'Question:\\nHow to configure vim to not put comments at the beginning of lines while editing python files\\n\\nAnswer:\\nI found an answer here <a href=\"http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Restoring_indent_after_typing_hash\">http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Restoring_indent_after_typing_hash\\n\\nIt seems that the vim smartindent option is the cause of the problem.\\nThe referenced page above describes work-a-rounds but after reading the help in smartindent in vim itself (:help smartindent), I decided to try cindent instead of smartindent.\\n\\nI replaced \\n\\nset smartindent\\n\\n\\nwith \\n\\nset cindent\\n\\n\\nin my .vimrc file\\n\\nand so far it is working perfectly.\\n\\nThis changed also fixed the behavior of \\'&lt;&lt;\\' and \\'>>\\' for indenting visual blocks that include python comments.\\n\\nThere are more configuration options for and information on indentation in the vim help for smartindent and cindent (:help smartindent and :help cindent).\\n',\n 'Question:\\nAre there statistical studies that indicates that Python is \"more productive\"?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nYes, and there are also statistical studies that prove that dogs are more productive than cats.

The standards committee couldn't agree on a behavior so it was left undefined).  \\n\\nWhen this happens to work in C it relies on fixed bit-width integers so that the leftmost bit gets pushed off the end when you do a shift (it also requires the sign bit to be treated as a value bit for shifting purposes).  All integer types in C are fixed-bit but Python numbers can be arbitrarily large.

Unicode is just a table of characters. √¢\\x84\\x9665 is latin capital A. √¢\\x84\\x96937 is greek capital omega. Just that.\\n\\nIn order for a computer to store and-or manipulate Unicode, it has to encode it into bytes. The most straightforward encoding of Unicode is UCS-4; every character occupies 4 bytes, and all ~1000000 characters are available. The 4 bytes contain the number of the character in the Unicode tables as a 4-byte integer. Another very useful encoding is UTF-8, which can encode any Unicode character with one to four bytes. But there also are some limited encodings, like \"latin1\", which include a very limited range of characters, mostly used by Western countries. Such encodings use only one byte per character.\\n\\nBasically, Unicode can be encoded with many encodings, and encoded strings can be decoded to Unicode. The thing is, Unicode came quite late, so all of us that grew up using an 8-bit character set learned too late that all this time we worked with encoded strings. The encoding could be ISO8859-1, or windows CP437, or CP850, or, or, or, depending on our system default.\\n\\nSo when, in your source code, you enter the string \"add √¢\\x80\\x9cMonitoring√¢\\x80\\x9c to list\" (and I think you wanted the string \"add √¢\\x80\\x9cMonitoring√¢\\x80\\x9d to list\", note the second quote), you actually are using a string already encoded according to your system\\'s default codepage (by the byte \\\\x93 I assume you use Windows codepage 1252, √¢\\x80\\x9cWestern√¢\\x80\\x9d). If you want to get Unicode from that, you need to decode the string from the \"cp1252\" encoding.\\n\\nSo, what you meant to do, was:\\n\\n\"add \\\\x93Monitoring\\\\x94 to list\".decode(\"cp1252\", \"ignore\")\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that Python 2.x includes an .encode method for strings too; this is a convenience function for \"special\" encodings, like the \"zip\" or \"rot13\" or \"base64\" ones, which have nothing to do with Unicode.\\n\\nAnyway, all you have to remember for your to-and-fro Unicode conversions is:\\n\\n\\na Unicode string gets encoded to a Python 2.x string (actually, a sequence of bytes)\\na Python 2.x string gets decoded to a Unicode string\\n\\n\\nIn both cases, you need to specify the encoding that will be used.\\n\\nI\\'m not very clear, I\\'m sleepy, but I sure hope I help.\\n\\nPS A humorous side note: Mayans didn\\'t have Unicode; ancient Romans, ancient Greeks, ancient Egyptians didn\\'t too. They all had their own \"encodings\", and had little to no respect for other cultures. All these civilizations crumbled to dust. Think about it people! Make your apps Unicode-aware, for the good of mankind. :)\\n\\nPS2 Please don\\'t spoil the previous message by saying \"But the Chinese√¢\\x80¬¶\". If you feel inclined or obligated to do so, though, delay it by thinking that the Unicode BMP is populated mostly by chinese ideograms, ergo Chinese is the basis of Unicode. I can go on inventing outrageous lies, as long as people develop Unicode-aware applications.

For many people these two are closely intertwined, but are, in fact two separate things.\\n\\nInternally Stackless uses a round-robin scheduler to schedule every <a href=\"http://www.stackless.com/wiki/Tasklets\">tasklet (micro threads), but no tasklet can be run concurrent with another one. This means that if one tasklet is busy, the others must wait until that tasklet relinquishes control. By default the scheduler will not stop a tasklet and give processor time to another. It is the tasklet\\'s responsibility to schedule itself back in the end of the schedule queue using Stackless.schedule(), or by finishing its calculations.\\n\\nall tasklets are thus executed in a sequential manner, even when multiplpe cores are available.\\n\\nThe reason why Stackless does not have multi-core support is because this makes threads a whole lot easier.
