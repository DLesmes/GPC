This is important.\\n\\nThe part I didn\\'t get is that in the example construction\\n\\ngroups = []\\nuniquekeys = []\\nfor k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):\\n   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list\\n   uniquekeys.append(k)\\n\\n\\nk is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of that, using clearer variable names:\\n\\nfrom itertools import groupby\\n\\nthings = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    for thing in group:\\n        print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key)\\n    print \" \"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  A bear is a animal.\\n  A duck is a animal.\\n  \\n  A cactus is a plant.\\n  \\n  A speed boat is a vehicle.\\n  A school bus is a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nIn this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. \\n\\nThe groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. \\n\\nHere, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.\\n\\nIn the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.\\n\\nHere\\'s a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group])\\n    print key + \"s:  \" + listOfThings + \".\"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  animals: bear and duck.\\n  plants: cactus.\\n  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.\\n\\n'}\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n1. {'Question': \"Why is ''>0 True in Python?\", 'Answer': 'The original design motivation for allowing order-comparisons of arbitrary objects was to allow sorting of heterogenous lists -- usefully, that would put all strings next to each other in alphabetical order, and all numbers next to each other in numerical order, although which of the two blocks came first was not guaranteed by the language.  For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n'}\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n2. {'Question': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?', 'Answer': '&gt;&gt;&gt;

For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n',\n  'timestamp': 1712892785},\n {'reply_id': '6994527b-a077-44b7-84c7-5177fab208d7',\n  'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?',\n  'timestamp': 1712892785},\n {'reply_id': 'cd07d14a-6bca-4dc4-91f2-fc6c546a00a2',\n  'role': 'assitant',\n  'content': '&gt;&gt;&gt;

This is a module mainly written in C, which will be much faster than programming in pure python. Here is an example of how to invert a matrix, and do other matrix manipulation.\n\nfrom numpy import matrix\nfrom numpy import linalg\nA = matrix( [[1,2,3],[11,12,13],[21,22,23]]) # Creates a matrix.\nx = matrix( [[1],[2],[3]] )                  # Creates a matrix (like a column vector).\ny = matrix( [[1,2,3]] )                      # Creates a matrix (like a row vector).\nprint A.T                                    # Transpose of A.\nprint A*x                                    # Matrix multiplication of A and x.\nprint A.I                                    # Inverse of A.\nprint linalg.solve(A, x)     # Solve the linear equation system.\n\n\nYou can also have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-array.html\">array module, which is a much more efficient implementation of lists when you have to deal with only one data type.\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: How to integrate pep8.py in Eclipse?\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: As of PyDev 2.3.0, pep8 is integrated in PyDev by default, even shipping with a default version of it.\n\nOpen Window > Preferences\n\nIt must be enabled in PyDev > Editor > Code Analysis > pep8.py\n\nErrors/Warnings should be shown as markers (as other things in the regular code analysis).\n\nIn the event a file is not analyzed, see <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/31001619/832230\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/31001619/832230.\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: How can I select all of the Sundays for a year using Python?\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assitant: You can use date from the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html\">datetime module to find the first Sunday in a year and then keep adding seven days, generating new Sundays:\n\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\n\ndef allsundays(year):\n   d = date(year, 1, 1)                    # January 1st\n   d += timedelta(days = 6 - d.weekday())  # First Sunday\n   while d.year == year:\n      yield d\n      d += timedelta(days = 7)\n\nfor d in allsundays(2010):\n   print d\n\n\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->user: \nwhat PEPs Introduces the concept of decorators, a powerful feature in Python.\n\n<-change-of-interlocutor->assistant:\n",

For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n',\n  'timestamp': 1712892785},\n {'reply_id': '6994527b-a077-44b7-84c7-5177fab208d7',\n  'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?',\n  'timestamp': 1712892785},\n {'reply_id': 'cd07d14a-6bca-4dc4-91f2-fc6c546a00a2',\n  'role': 'assitant',\n  'content': '&gt;&gt;&gt;
