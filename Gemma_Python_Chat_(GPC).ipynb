This is important.\\n\\nThe part I didn\\'t get is that in the example construction\\n\\ngroups = []\\nuniquekeys = []\\nfor k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):\\n   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list\\n   uniquekeys.append(k)\\n\\n\\nk is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of that, using clearer variable names:\\n\\nfrom itertools import groupby\\n\\nthings = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    for thing in group:\\n        print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key)\\n    print \" \"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  A bear is a animal.\\n  A duck is a animal.\\n  \\n  A cactus is a plant.\\n  \\n  A speed boat is a vehicle.\\n  A school bus is a vehicle.\\n\\n\\nIn this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. \\n\\nThe groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. \\n\\nHere, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.\\n\\nIn the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.\\n\\nHere\\'s a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group])\\n    print key + \"s:  \" + listOfThings + \".\"\\n\\n\\nThis will give you the output:\\n\\n\\n  animals: bear and duck.\\n  plants: cactus.\\n  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.\\n\\n'}\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n1. {'Question': \"Why is ''>0 True in Python?\", 'Answer': 'The original design motivation for allowing order-comparisons of arbitrary objects was to allow sorting of heterogenous lists -- usefully, that would put all strings next to each other in alphabetical order, and all numbers next to each other in numerical order, although which of the two blocks came first was not guaranteed by the language.  For example, this allowed getting only unique items in any list (even one with non-hashable items) in O(N log N) worst-case time\\n\\nOver the years, this pragmatical arrangement was eroded.  The first crack was when the ability to order-compare complex numbers was taken away, quite a few versions ago: suddenly, the ability to sort any list disappeared (did not apply any more if the list contained complex numbers, possibly together with items of other types).  Then Guido started disliking heterogeneous lists more generally, and thus thinking that it didn\\'t really matter if such lists could be usefully sorted or not... because such lists should not exist in the first place, according to his new thinking.  He didn\\'t do anything to forbid them, but was not inclined to accept any compromises to support them either.\\n\\nNote that both changes move the balance a little bit away from the \"practicality beats purity\" item of the Zen of Python (which was written earlier, back when complex numbers still could be order-compared;-) -- a bit more purity, a bit less practicality.\\n\\nNevertheless the ability to order-compare two arbitrary objects (as long as neither was a complex number;-) remained for a long time, because around that same time Guido started really insisting on maintaining strong backwards compatibility (a shift that\\'s both practical and pure;-).\\n\\nSo, it\\'s only in Python 3, which explicitly and deliberately removed the constraint of strong backwards compatibility to allow some long-desired but backwards incompatible enhancements (especially simplifications and removal of obsolete, redundant way to perform certain tasks), that order comparison of instances of different types became an error.\\n\\nSo this historical and philosophical treatise is basically the only way to truly respond to your \"why\" question...!-)\\n'}\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n2. {'Question': 'How to check what OS am I running on in Python?', 'Answer': '&gt;&gt;&gt;

PEP 484 is prescriptive but it is the de facto standard\\nfor most of the consumers of annotations; in many statically checked\\ncode bases, where type annotations are widely used, they have\\neffectively crowded out any other form of annotation. Some of the use\\ncases for annotations described in PEP 3107 (database mapping,\\nforeign languages bridge) are not currently realistic given the\\nprevalence of type annotations. Furthermore, the standardisation of type\\nannotations rules out advanced features only supported by specific type\\ncheckers.\\n\\n\\nRationale\\nThis PEP adds an Annotated type to the typing module to decorate\\nexisting types with context-specific metadata. Specifically, a type\\nT can be annotated with metadata x via the typehint\\nAnnotated[T, x]. This metadata can be used for either static\\nanalysis or at runtime. If a libr'"

Some tool providers (at least VS Code\\nand PyCharm) have shown they would consider implementing support for this only if\\nit was a standard.\\nThis doesn‚Äôt deprecate current usage of docstrings, docstrings should be considered',\n 'Rationale\\nBack in the early days of Python, the interpreter came with a large set of\\nuseful modules. This was often referred to as ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù\\nphilosophy and was one of the cornerstones to Python‚Äôs success story.\\nUsers didn‚Äôt have to figure out how to download and install separate\\npackages in order to write a simple web server or parse email.\\nTimes have changed. With the introduction of PyPI (n√©e Cheeseshop), setuptools,\\nand later pip, it became simple and straightforward to download and install\\npackages. Nowadays Python has a rich and vibrant ecosystem of third-party\\npackages. It‚Äôs pretty much standard to either install packages from PyPI or\\nuse one of the many Python or Linux distributions.\\nOn the other hand, Python‚Äôs standard library is piling up with cruft, unnecessary\\nduplication of functionality, and dispensable features. This is undesirable\\nfor several reasons.',\n 'PyPy\\nSome of the PyPy developers have responded to a request for feedback\\n[9].  Armin Rigo said the following [10]:\\nFor myself, I can only say that it looks like a good idea, which we\\nwill happily adhere to when we migrate to Python 3.3.\\n\\n\\nHe also expressed support for keeping the required list small.  Both\\nArmin and Laura Creighton indicated that an effort to better catalog\\nPython‚Äôs implementation would be welcome.  Such an effort, for which\\nthis PEP is a small start, will be considered separately.\\n\\n\\nPast Efforts\\n\\nPEP 3139\\nPEP 3139, from 2008, recommended a clean-up of the sys module in\\npart by extracting implementation-specific variables and functions\\ninto a separate module.  PEP 421 is less ambitious version of that\\nidea.  While PEP 3139 was rejected, its goals are reflected in PEP 421\\nto a large extent, though with a much lighter approach.',\n 'And generally:\\n\\nIs consistent with iterator-based ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù changes already\\nincluded (as of Python 2.1) for other builtin types such as:\\nlists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, and files.\\n\\n\\n\\nBackwards Compatibility\\nThe proposed mechanism is generally backwards compatible as it\\ncalls for neither new syntax nor new keywords.  All existing,\\nvalid Python programs should continue to work unmodified.\\nHowever, this proposal is not perfectly backwards compatible in\\nthe sense that certain statements that are currently invalid\\nwould, under the current proposal, become valid.\\nTim Peters has pointed out two such examples:\\n\\nThe common case where one forgets to include range() or\\nxrange(), for example:for rowcount in table.getRowCount():\\n    print table.getValueAt(rowcount, 0)',\n 'Rationale\\nSo far, we have 4 major Python implementations ‚Äì CPython, Jython,\\nIronPython, and PyPy ‚Äì as well as lots of minor ones.  Some of\\nthese already run on platforms that do aggressive optimizations.  In\\ngeneral, these optimizations are invisible within a single thread of\\nexecution, but they can be visible to other threads executing\\nconcurrently.  CPython currently uses a GIL to ensure that other\\nthreads see the results they expect, but this limits it to a single\\nprocessor.  Jython and IronPython run on Java‚Äôs or .NET‚Äôs threading\\nsystem respectively, which allows them to take advantage of more cores\\nbut can also show surprising values to other threads.\\nSo that threaded Python programs continue to be portable between\\nimplementations, implementers and library authors need to agree on\\nsome ground rules.\\n\\n\\nA couple definitions',\n 'Motivation\\nFor a number of years now, the distinction between Python-the-language\\nand CPython (the reference implementation) has been growing.  Most of\\nthis change is due to the emergence of Jython, IronPython, and PyPy as\\nviable alternate implementations of Python.\\nConsider, however, the nearly two decades of CPython-centric Python\\n(i.e. most of its existence).  That focus has understandably\\ncontributed to quite a few CPython-specific artifacts both in the\\nstandard library and exposed in the interpreter.  Though the core\\ndevelopers have made an effort in recent years to address this, quite\\na few of the artifacts remain.\\nPart of the solution is presented in this PEP: a single namespace in\\nwhich to consolidate implementation specifics.  This will help focus\\nefforts to differentiate the implementation specifics from the\\nlanguage.  Additionally, it will foster a multiple-implementation\\nmindset.',\n 'Rationale\\nThere are two current approaches to bringing co-routines to Python.\\nChristian Tismer‚Äôs Stackless [6] involves a ground-up restructuring\\nof Python‚Äôs execution model by hacking the ‚ÄòC‚Äô stack.  While this\\napproach works, its operation is hard to describe and keep portable. A\\nrelated approach is to compile Python code to Parrot [7], a\\nregister-based virtual machine, which has coroutines.  Unfortunately,\\nneither of these solutions is portable with IronPython (CLR) or Jython\\n(JavaVM).\\nIt is thought that a more limited approach, based on iterators, could\\nprovide a coroutine facility to application programmers and still be\\nportable across runtimes.',\n 'Rationale\\nPython has grown beyond the CPython virtual machine (VM). IronPython,\\nJython, and PyPy are all currently viable alternatives to the\\nCPython VM. The VM ecosystem that has sprung up around the Python\\nprogramming language has led to Python being used in many different\\nareas where CPython cannot be used, e.g., Jython allowing Python to be\\nused in Java applications.\\nA problem all of the VMs other than CPython face is handling modules\\nfrom the standard library that are implemented (to some extent) in C.\\nSince other VMs do not typically support the entire C API of CPython\\nthey are unable to use the code used to create the module. Oftentimes\\nthis leads these other VMs to either re-implement the modules in pure\\nPython or in the programming language used to implement the VM itself\\n(e.g., in C# for IronPython). This duplication of effort between\\nCPython, PyPy, Jython, and IronPython is extremely unfortunate as\\nimplementing a module at least in pure Python would help mitigate',\n 'Rationale\\nOne place where flexibility has been lacking in Python is in the direct\\nexecution of Python code. While CPython‚Äôs C API [2] allows for\\nconstructing the data going into a frame object and then evaluating it\\nvia PyEval_EvalFrameEx() [5], control over the\\nexecution of Python code comes down to individual objects instead of a\\nholistic control of execution at the frame level.\\nWhile wanting to have influence over frame evaluation may seem a bit\\ntoo low-level, it does open the possibility for things such as a\\nmethod-level JIT to be introduced into CPython without CPython itself\\nhaving to provide one. By allowing external C code to control frame\\nevaluation, a JIT can participate in the execution of Python code at\\nthe key point where evaluation occurs. This then allows for a JIT to\\nconditionally recompile Python bytecode to machine code as desired\\nwhile still allowing for executing regular CPython bytecode when\\nrunning the JIT is not desired. This can be accomplished by allowing',\n 'Rationale\\nThis idea was proposed by Guido van Rossum on the python-ideas [1] mailing\\nlist.
